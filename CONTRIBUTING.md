# Contributing to Segment Docs

## Getting Started

Before you begin:

- This site is powered by [Jekyll](https://www.jekyllrb.com).
- Please familiarize yourself with the licensing agreement.
- Browse existing issues to see if your issue has been raised already.

## Use the contribution links from any docs page

Not all pages have a 1-1 mapping with their location within the repository. This can make browsing and locating the file you're trying to reference a challenge. As you browse [segment.com/docs](https://segment.com/docs), you'll notice two links in the right sidebar, at the top of the page. Click **Edit this page** to open the page in the GitHub editor. Or, click **Request docs change** to create a new issue that references the page.

This is the best path to update a single page, or make a small change to a single article.

## Want to go deeper? Fork the repository

You can fork this repository and clone it to your local machine to make larger changes. Examples of larger changes include:
- editing more than one file at a time
- adding or updating images
- updating navigation items

In this scenario, you'll fork the repository, clone it locally, make your changes, and submit a pull request to have them reviewed and merged back into the site. For more information, see the [Dev Guide](devguide.md).

## Have your changes reviewed

When you update a page on the Segment Docs site, either by the "Edit this page" link, or by forking the repository, your changes will go through the Pull Request process. When you open a Pull Request, you're saying "Hey Segment Docs team, I'd like to update the site with these updates." When the Pull Request is opened, it is assigned for review to the docs writer who is most active in that area of the documentation. This is maintained in the CODEOWNERS file. If there is no writer assigned to a specific area, your pull request will be randomly assigned to a member of the team.

Once you submit, the reviewer may have questions about your submission. This conversation will take place with GitHub conversations in the context of the Pull Request.

When your Pull Request is approved and merged, it will go live on the site with the teams next deploy (mornings, Pacific time on Tuesdays and Thursdays).

## Site structure

As mentioned, the Segment docs site is powered by Jekyll, with a few customizations and enhancements. Generally speaking, everything you'll need to edit is located in the `_src/` directory. This directory contains the data files, layouts, sass, and markdown source files that combine to make a live, working website.

Within the `/src/` path, anything that starts with an underscore (like `_data` or `_includes`) is a utility directory, and Jekyll won't render it as a webpage path at build time. (In fact, any files where the name starts with an underscore are dropped from the build.)

### Underscore files

Anything that starts with an `_` is a utility directory of some sort (and Jekyll will skip/not render any file that starts with a `_`).

The most interesting ones are:
- `/src/_includes/content/` This is where all the includes or "partials" - the reusable content - are stored.
- `/src/_data/catalog/` This is where data pulled from the Public API is stored, in structured `yml` files that are used by the build.
- `/src/_data/sidenav/` This is where the navigation structures are. (Several sections in the doc have their own left-nav, making them "microsites".) They're just YML files that manually updated.


### Images

**Save all images locally! No linking to third-party hosted images!** Images are published to the Netlify CDN from the build step.

There are no _enforced_ naming conventions. Files that start with an underscore are ignored by Jekyll.

It's a good practice to name images with a description that helps you (& other docs maintainers) figure out where they should go within a page, or within a larger folder of images.

A few possibilities/suggestions:

- **Add a prefix of what file the image appears in**. This is helpful if you have images for multiple pages in the same `images` directory, but breaks down a bit if you reuse images across multiple pages.
- **Give a prefix of the application the screenshot shows**. For example `atom-new-file.png`, `atom-commit-changes.png` etc),
- **Name images to describe a process flow**. For example `checkout-1-add-to-cart.png`, `checkout-2-est-shipping.png` and so on.


### Content structure

There are folders for each of the top level products, and those folders might also contain topics that are related to that product area (for example the Privacy Portal section also contains GDPR/CCPA docs).

For the Connections product, the section is divided into the Spec, then Sources, Destinations, and Storage Destinations (formerly called "Warehouses"), with general accessory topics at the folder root. (More specific accessory topics are in each sub directory.)

Each also contains a `catalog` directory, which contains all the directories with information about specific integrations. The top-level of this `catalog` folder (the `index.md`) is a pretty "catalog" page which gives a tile-like view by category, suitable for browsing. It pulls the logo for these tiles from the path for the integration in the metadata, either in `destinations.yml`, `sources.yml`, or `warehouses.yml`.


### Programmatic content

Programmatic content is sections of documentation that are built conditionally, or using public information from the Public API.

Programmatic content is built using information in the files in `/src/_data/catalog/`. These files (with the exception of `warehouses.yml`) are built by the `make catalog` command, which contacts the public Public API, gets a list of all the available integrations using the Catalog endpoint, and then parses them into static `.yml` files.

Most of the programmatic content is built into the `_layouts` templates that each page uses. Sources, Destinations, and Warehouses use the `integration.html` template, which uses some Liquid logic, and calls an `include` depending on the integration type. Most of logic for the actual content must live in the include file itself, however logic controlling *if* the include is built can live in the `layout`.

Destination pages include the `destination-dossier.html` and `destination_footer.md` content, which use Liquid scripting and pulls from the catalog metadata.

Sources pages check if the source is a cloud-app, then include information about if the source is an object or event source, based on the `type` data from the ConfigAPI.

## Edit pages

Content with in each `.md` file is markdown. For information about styling, and available extensions, see `_src/utils/formatguide.md` or the live version [here](https://segment.com/docs/utils/formatguide).

### Front matter

Repository Markdown files often contain front matter metadata, which you'll find at the top of the file. These front matter variables instruct Jekyll how to build and render the page as HTML.

Front matter in a file will look something like this:

```md
---
title: Analytics.js Library
hide-feedback: false
---
```

Front matter variables have unique functions, including the following:

#### Content-related front matter
- `beta`: default false. When true, show an "in beta" warning in the page layout (see the warning in `_includes/content/beta-note.md`)
- `hide-dossier`: defaults to false. When true, hides the "quick info" box at the top of a destination page.
- `hide-boilerplate`: defaults to false. When true, none of the content from `destination-footer.md` is appended to the destination page.
- `hide-cmodes`: defaults to false. A renaming of "rewrite" for more clarity, hides the connection modes table in the boilerplate.
- `hide-personas-partial`: defaults to false. When true, hides the section of content from `destination-footer.md` that talks about being able to receive personas data.
- `integration_type`: This is set in the `_config.yml` on three paths to add a noun (Source, Destination, or Warehouse) to the end of the title, and the end of the title tag in the html layout. It also controls the layout and icon for some of these.
- `source-type`: These are only used to supplement when a Cloud App in the sources path doesn't appear in the Config API list, and needs its type explicitly set. It runs some logic in the `cloud-app-note.md` to explain which cloud-apps are object vs event sources.

#### Utility front matter
- `published`: defaults to true. Set this to "false" to prevent Jekyll from rendering an HTML page for this file. Good for when you're working on something in the repository but aren't ready to release it yet, and don't want to use a Draft PR.
- `hidden`: omits the file from the `sitemap.xml`, adds a `<meta name="robots" content="noindex" />` to the top of the generated HTML file, and drops it from the convenience script for regenerating the nav.
- `hide-sidebar`: defaults to false. When true, hide the entire right-nav sidebar. Use with `hide-feedback` if you want to disable *all* feedback opportunities.
- `hide-feedback`: defaults to false. When true, hide the feedback in both nav and footer. Good for landing pages.
- `hide_toc`: hides the right-nav TOC that's generated from H2s. Also good for landing pages.
- `landing`: defaults to false. Use this to drop the noun set by `integration_type` from the tab title.
- `redirect_from`: Defaults to null. Takes an array of URLs from the front matter in a file, and generates a "stub" page at each URL at build-time. Each stub file redirects to the original file. Use the path from the root of the content directory, for example `/connections/destinations/catalog/` rather than `/docs/connections/destinations/catalog/`.
- `seo-changefreq`: default: `weekly `. Use the values [in the sitemap spec](https://www.sitemaps.org/protocol.html#xmlTagDefinitions). - sets the `changefreq` tag in the sitemap.xml generator, which tells search crawlers how often to check back.
- `seo-priority`: values from `1.0` to `0.1`, default: `0.5 `. Sets the `Priority` tag in the sitemap
