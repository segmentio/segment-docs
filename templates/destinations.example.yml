Facebook recognizes certain [standard events](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/marketing-api/app-event-api/v2.6) that can be used across Custom Audiences, custom conversions, conversion tracking, and conversion optimization. When you map an event to a standard Facebook event, we'll send the event by that name. Any unmapped events will still be sent as Custom Events.


      **Facebook Recommended Events**

      The most important events that can help advertisers improve campaign ROI are the conversion events or events closest to the conversion. Those events are marked with an *.

      In addition, there are special requirements for dynamic ads. These events are marked with "m" for dynamic ads for mobile, and "t" for dynamic ads for travel.

This whitelist will be respected exactly (or not at all, if you choose not to use it), the only exception being that we will automatically send `_eventName` to ensure all events are valid. Top-level properties will be mapped exactly. (For example, if you whitelist `someProp` then we will send `someProp`'s value). We otherwise make the following conversions for Facebook-spec'd events. Use the value on the `right-hand` side if you wish to send these properties as we calculate them.

      map those traits and properties to Google Analytics custom dimensions if you
      want them to be sent to GA. Enter a trait or property name on the left. Choose
      the Google Analytics dimension you want on the right. Google Analytics only
      accepts numbered dimensions (e.g. dimension3). We suggest using user-scoped
      dimensions for trait mappings and hit-scoped dimensions for properties [Contact

    description: Google Analytics allows users to either pass custom dimensions /

      behavior is the latter. Any metrics / dimensions that are mapped to a given
      property will be set to the page and sent as properties of all subsequent events
      on that page. You can disable this functionality with this setting. If disabled,
      Segment will only pass custom dimensions / metrics as part of the payload of
      the event with which they are explicitly associated. Please reference the Google
