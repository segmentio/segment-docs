## Settings

Segment lets you change these destination settings via your Segment dashboard without having to touch any code.

{% for options in destination %}
{% if destination.option.hidden == false and destination.option.label != "Unused" %}
### {{ destination.option.label }}
{{ destination.option.description }}
{% endif %}
