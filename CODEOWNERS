# Content owners should be in the order of PM, TL (team-lead), and EM (in a crisis) for a given team.
# This team will receive review requests automatically when a PR is submitted modifying the files in
# a given directory+subtree, or file type, etc. that matches below.  While Github won't enforce the
# order names are listed in for the PR review, this file can provide insight on who should be contacted
# if anything becomes time sensitive.  Names other than the PM can mostly ignore these review notifications
# but are listed here as backup.
