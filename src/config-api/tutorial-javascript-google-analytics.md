Segment makes it easy to collect data from cloud services (for example, advertising, helpdesk, and marketing) and send it to many destination services (for example, CRM services and data warehouses).

A common use case is to send data from your website into Google Analytics to understand you website users.

This tutorial uses the Config API to:

* Create a JavaScript source
* Create Google Analytics destination
* Update Google Analytics settings

Finally it uses the Tracking API to:

* Send sample events

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, you'll need to get your Google Analytics website tracking ID, and create an access token in the Segment App.

### Google Analytics Website Tracking ID

The Google Analytics integration requires a Google account and website tracking ID. See the Google [Set Up Analytics Tracking doc](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/1008080?hl=en) for instructions to create an ID.

### Personal Access Token

You can programmatically access resources that you own in using Config API as long as you have an access token. Segment users can generate access tokens for an individual workspace, with permissions for resources in that workspace. These tokens can then be used to access those resources.
See the [Authentication](/docs/config-api/authentication/) doc for more information.

To set up Segment Protocols through the API you first need to create a personal access token with **full access** to your workspace through the `workspace` scope.

> success ""
> **Tip**: As best practice, tokens should be assigned the least permissions needed to perform a required API action, however for simplicity in this demo, we'll select Workspace Owner. You may want to delete the token once you've finished this demo.

1. Log in to your Segment workspace.
2. Click **Settings** in the left navigation bar.
3. Click **Access Management**, then the **Tokens** tab, and click **Create Token**.
4. For purposes of this demonstration, select **Workspace Owner** as the token's scope.
5. Enter a description for the token. For this demo, we recommend using `demo-token` so it's easy to find and remove later.
6. Click **Create**.

The token payload appears in the dialog. Copy the payload and save it in a secure location, like a password- or secrets-manager app.

> warning "Secret Token"
> You can not retrieve the plain-text `token` later, so you should save it in a secret manager. If you lose the `token` you can generate a new one.

Now that you have a personal access token, you can use it to access the Config API by setting it in the `Authorization` header of your requests, for example:

```shell
$ ACCESS_TOKEN=qiTgISif4zprgBb_5j4hXfp3qhDbxrntWwwOaHgAMr8.gg9ok4Bk7sWlP67rFyXeH3ABBsXyWqNuoXbXZPv1y2g

$ curl \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ACCESS_TOKEN" \
  https://platform.segmentapis.com/v1beta/workspaces
```

Example response:
```json
{
 "workspaces": [
  {
   "name": "myworkspace",
   "display_name": "My Space",
   "id": "bb296fce9c",
   "create_time": "2012-08-12T15:40:04.406Z"
  }
 ]
}
```

## Create a Javascript Source

Data collection on Segment happens through "event sources". Event sources are created with a type that describes the environment you are sending events from, e.g. `javascript` for a website, `ios` for a mobile app, and `go` for a server. Segment gives each event source a unique "write key" that you configure the Segment SDK with.

Let's create a Javascript event source:

```shell
$ ACCESS_TOKEN=1fUBblCni_qlYlUdBkv16tVrTtxJjv4uWLB2y9NYsUo.INcqwxms0p4OI_4ZeUyUiGFBwXJ7VyHYwtQNLQ3nu-g

$ curl \
  -X POST \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ACCESS_TOKEN" \
  -d "{'source': {'name': 'workspaces/$WORKSPACE/sources/js', 'catalog_name': 'catalog/sources/javascript'}}" \
  https://platform.segmentapis.com/v1beta/workspaces/$WORKSPACE/sources
```

<span class="example">Example response:</span>

```json
{
 "slug": "js",
 "name": "workspaces/myworkspace/sources/js",
 "parent": "workspaces/myworkspace",
 "catalog_name": "catalog/sources/javascript",
 "write_keys": [
  "LxKXARX9IuqR9v0gn7y2Fw1iHi0ephbF"
 ],
 "create_time": "2018-09-12T21:15:54.169Z",
 "library_source_config": {}
}
```

> Analytics.js
>
> The Javascript source requires that you add analytics.js to your website to collect data. See the [Quickstart: Analytics.js](https://segment.com/docs/connections/sources/catalog/libraries/website/javascript/quickstart/) guide for full details.

## Create a Google Analytics Destination

On Segment, events are sent in real-time to "streaming destination" services. Destinations are created with the name of the service, e.g. `google-analytics`, and configuration for the services such as the website tracking ID.

Let's create a Google Analytics destination. Note that we are setting the `CLOUD` connection mode that sends data to Google Analytics via Segment's servers. Also note that we are setting the website tracking ID from our Google Analytics account.

```shell
$ curl \
  -X POST \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ACCESS_TOKEN" \
  -d "{
    'destination': {
      'name': 'workspaces/$WORKSPACE/sources/js/destinations/google-analytics',
      'connection_mode': 'CLOUD',
      'config': [
        {
          'value': 'UA-970334309-1',
          'type': 'string',
          'name': 'workspaces/$WORKSPACE/sources/js/destinations/google-analytics/config/trackingId'
        }
      ]
    }
  }" \
  https://platform.segmentapis.com/v1beta/workspaces/$WORKSPACE/sources/js/destinations
```

<span class="example">Example response:</span>

```json
{
 "slug": "google-analytics",
 "name": "workspaces/myworkspace/sources/js/destinations/google-analytics",
 "parent": "workspaces/myworkspace/sources/js",
 "display_name": "Google Analytics",
 "create_time": "2018-09-24T17:08:04.138Z",
 "update_time": "2018-09-24T17:08:04.138Z",
 "enabled": false,
 "connection_mode": "CLOUD",
 "config": [
  {
   "name": "workspaces/myworkspace/sources/js/destinations/google-analytics/config/trackingId",
   "display_name": "Website Tracking ID",
   "value": "UA-970334309-1",
   "type": "string"
  },
  ...
 ]
}
```

## Update Google Analytics Settings

Over time we may want to modify the Google Analytics destination settings. First, the destination was created as disabled by default, so we can use the API to enable it. We can also toggle other settings like "[server side identify](https://segment.com/docs/connections/destinations/catalog/google-analytics/#server-side-identify)". Note the required `update_mask` field that explicitly specifies the fields you want to update.

```shell
$ curl -i \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ACCESS_TOKEN" \
  -X PATCH \
  -d "{
    'destination': {
      'enabled': 'true',
      'config': [
        {
          'name': 'workspaces/$WORKSPACE/sources/js/destinations/google-analytics/config/enableServerIdentify',
          'type': 'boolean',
          'value': true
        }
      ]
    },
    'update_mask': {
      'paths': ['destination.enabled', 'destination.config']
    }
  }" \
  https://platform.segmentapis.com/v1beta/workspaces/$WORKSPACE/sources/js/destinations/google-analytics
```

<span class="example">Example response:</span>

```json
{
 "slug": "google-analytics",
 "name": "workspaces/myworkspace/sources/js/destinations/google-analytics",
 "parent": "workspaces/myworkspace/sources/js",
 "display_name": "Google Analytics",
 "create_time": "2018-09-24T17:08:04.138Z",
 "update_time": "2018-09-24T17:16:42.499Z",
 "enabled": true,
 "connection_mode": "CLOUD",
 "config": [
  {
   "name": "workspaces/myworkspace/sources/js/destinations/google-analytics/config/enableServerIdentify",
   "display_name": "Enable Server Side Identify",
   "value": true,
   "type": "boolean"
  },
  {
   "name": "workspaces/myworkspace/sources/js/destinations/google-analytics/config/trackingId",
   "display_name": "Website Tracking ID",
   "value": "UA-970334309-1",
   "type": "string"
  },
  ...
 ]
}
```

See the [Google Analytics Destination](https://segment.com/docs/connections/destinations/catalog/google-analytics/) reference for all the settings.

## Send Sample Events

We can also test our source and destination by interacting with the Tracking API from the command line.

Let's send an events to our new source. Note that `userID` is required and the `name` and `url` properties are expected by Google Analytics and other website tools. See the [Page API spec](https://segment.com/docs/connections/sources/catalog/libraries/server/http/#page) for more details.

```shell
$ WRITE_KEY=LxKXARX9IuqR9v0gn7y2Fw1iHi0ephbF

$ curl https://api.segment.io/v1/page \
  -u $WRITE_KEY: \
  -H 'Content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "userId": "78e56a08-ad10-42b1-88d2-b823623ac875",
    "name": "index",
    "properties": {
      "url": "https://example.com"
    },
    "context": {
      "library": "curl"
    }
  }'
```

To verify your events were sent to the source, open the event debugger in your browser, e.g. https://app.segment.com/myworkspace/sources/js/debugger.
