title: Git Sync Extension
---

Segment's Git extension lets you manage versioning by syncing changes you make in your Segment workspace to a Git repository.

Git Sync supports synchronization from Segment to Git. When you sync data from Segment to Git, you capture the current state of your workspace through a full sync and includes all new records and changes for supported resources. 

You can use [bidirectional sync](#bidirectional-sync) to sync data from Git to Segment. After you enable bidirectional sync, Segment automatically listens for pull requests in your repository and manages all related workspace changes.

## Set up Git Sync

Follow these steps to set up Git Sync:

1. In your Segment workspace, navigate to **Settings > Extensions**.
2. Click **Set up Git sync**.
3. On the **Configure service credentials** page, select a service and protocol, add your GitHub App, SSH private key, or GitHub token, then click **Next**.
    - To connect to GitLab or Bitbucket, use your SSH private key.

## Working with Git Sync

The Git sync extension syncs the following resources from Segment to your Git repository:

- [Sources](/docs/connections/sources/) and [Destinations](/docs/connections/destinations/)
- [Warehouses](/docs/connections/storage/warehouses/)
- [Destination Filters and Mappings](/docs/connections/destinations/destination-filters/) for Connections
- [Tracking Plans](/docs/protocols/tracking-plan/create/)
- [Functions](/docs/connections/functions/)
- [Transformations](/docs/protocols/transform/)
- [Reverse ETL](/docs/connections/reverse-etl/)
- [Users](/docs/segment-app/iam/concepts/#team-members) and [User groups](/docs/segment-app/iam/concepts/#user-groups)
- [Labels](/docs/segment-app/iam/labels/#where-can-i-create-labels)

The Git sync extension doesn't support the following resources:

- [Spaces](/docs/segment-app/workspace-home/)
- [Audiences](/docs/engage/audiences/) and [Journeys](/docs/engage/journeys/)
- [Data Graph](/docs/unify/data-graph/)
- Mappings for [Linked Audiences](/docs/engage/audiences/linked-audiences/)

Reach out to [Segment support](https://app.segment.com/workspaces?contact=1){:target="blank"} to request support for additional Git Sync resources.

After you set up the Git sync extension for the first time, Segment performs an initial sync that sends the current state of your Segment workspace to the Git repository you connected. Segment automatically tracks all following workspace updates.

You can manually trigger syncs at any time by clicking **Full Sync** on the Git Sync page. To disable Git Sync from the Git Sync page, switch the **Enabled** toggle to off.

## Git Sync architecture and data model

Because a Segment workspace can represent a distinct environment (testing, staging, production), each workspace is mapped directly to a single Git repository. This direct mapping ensures a clear and organized relationship between workspace resources and a Git repository.

Segment uses its [Terraform provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/segmentio/segment/1.0.3){:target="_blank"} to manage key functions like tracking changes and retrieving information about those changes in Segment. Segment stores changes in HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL), the format used by Terraform. To learn more about HCL and how it compares to JSON or YAML, visit [HashiCorp's HCL repository on GitHub](https://github.com/hashicorp/hcl){:target="_blank"}.

Using HCL makes it easier to document Segment's data model, especially for users managing versioning and Git Sync with Terraform. It also helps manage Segment configurations directly from Git. For more details on the Git Sync data model, read [Segment's Terraform provider documentation](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/segmentio/segment/latest/docs){:target="_blank"}.

## Managing your Segment workspace with Terraform and Git Sync

Segment supports one-way synchronization from Segment to Git, but you can set up two-way synchronization using the Segment Terraform provider.

Terraform offers an open-source way to manage Segment resources through a Git repository as an alternative to a fully managed two-way sync. This method requires third-party tools like [Atlantis](https://www.runatlantis.io/){:target="_blank"} for CI integration.

To manage Segment resources using Git and Terraform, follow these steps:

1. Copy the generated Terraform configuration for the resources you want to manage into a separate Git repository dedicated to Terraform.
2. Include the following provider configuration blocks:

    ```hcl
    # providers.tf

    terraform {
    required_providers {
        segment = {
        source  = "segmentio/segment"
        version = "1.0.4"
        }
    }
    }

    provider "segment" {
    # Provide the token directly or load it from an environment variable
    }
    ```
3. Apply configuration changes by running Terraform locally or using a tool like Atlantis to run it directly from your Git provider.


For more information on using Terraform, visit [Terraform's documentation](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/docs){:target="_blank"}.

## Bidirectional Sync

Bidirectional sync builds on top of the Git Sync extension and lets you manage your Segment workspace directly in GitHub. After you configure and enable bidirectional sync, Segment automatically listens for pull requests in your repository and manages all related workspace changes. Segment only applies changes when you comment `segment apply` on pull requests that can be successfully merged.

> info "Bidirectional sync is in Private Beta"
> Bidirectional sync is in private beta, and Segment is actively working on this feature. Some functionality may change before it becomes generally available.

Bidirectional sync only supports: 
- Explicit values ([secrets](#use-secrets-with-bidirectional-sync) require additional configuration)
- [Segment resources compatible with Git sync](#working-with-git-sync)

Bidirectional sync does not support variables, references to other resources, or resources from other providers.

> warning "Bidirectional sync can lead to broad workspace changes, including data loss"
> When using bidirectional sync to manage your Segment resources, verify that your specified plan matches the changes you expected. Unexpected changes can include data loss.

### Set up bidirectional sync

To set up bidirectional sync in your workspace: 

1. **Navigate to the Git Sync settings page to verify that your Git Sync integration is set up with Segment's GitHub App integration.** If it isn't, you can change the connection type under **Settings > Extensions > Git Sync > Manage Configuration**. If you were previously using the GitHub App integration, you might need to accept additional GitHub permissions that allow Segment to listen for the relevant events. 
2. **Add branch protection to your GitHub repository**. You can update your branch protections by opening GitHub and navigating to **Settings > Rules > Rulesets** and adding the Segment Extensions app to the **Bypass list**. 
3. **Navigate to the Segment app and enable Git sync bidirectional sync.** From the Segment app, navigate to **Settings > Extentions > Git Sync** page and enable the **Git sync bidirectional sync** setting. 

### Use bidirectional sync

To apply changes to your workspace using bidirectional sync: 

1. Create a branch off of the branch specified in your Git Sync configuration, make the changes you'd like to see in your workspace, then submit a pull request with your changes.
    - To add a new resource, add a *new* configuration file to the corresponding resource directory. Segment does not support multiple resources within the same file. The name does not matter, as it will be overwritten with a new ID after Segment creates the resource. 
2. Segment calculates the changes required to reflect those changes and outputs the planned changes to a comment directly on the pull request.
3. Carefully double check that the planned changes match your desired changes and request approval from any stakeholders required before merging the pull request. 
4. Run `segment apply` to apply the planned changes. 

#### Use secrets with bidirectional sync

To use secrets in your bidirectional sync workflow: 

1. Navigate to **Settings > Extensions > Git Sync > Manage Configuration** and upload your secret to the **Secrets** table.
2. When referencing your secret, use `@@<secret_name>@@` in place of your secret, wherever applicable. Secrets are automatically hidden in a bidirectional sync output, but if you are not using them in a designated secret field, like Source/Destination key settings, for example, they might be written in plaintext to the repository as part of the regular syncing process. 
3. Plan and apply the changes as usual. 

## Git Connections

Git Connections enable Segment to sync data with your preferred Git repository through supported like SSH and token-based authentication.

> info ""
> Git Sync and the dbt integration operate independently. You donâ€™t need to set up Git Sync to use dbt, and dbt Cloud can trigger its own syncs without relying on Git Sync.

### Supported connection types

Segment supports the following credential types for setting up a Git Connection:

- **SSH**: Compatible with GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket, SSH provides a secure method for connecting to your repository.
- **Git token**: Git tokens are also supported across GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket, enabling token-based authentication..
- **GitHub App**: For GitHub users, GitHub App integrations offer enhanced security and functionality. This method is exclusive to GitHub and supports additional features, like CI checks.

### Reusing Git Connections

Segment lets you set up multiple Git Connections, allowing you to reuse credentials across both dbt and Git Sync. You can either use the same credential for multiple configurations or create separate Git Connections for each product and environment as needed.

If you plan to reuse a Git token across both dbt and Git Sync, ensure it has the necessary read and write permissions for both integrations.

## Troubleshooting Git Sync

When setting up Git Sync, you may run into an access error with the following message: `â€œUnable to create Git Sync due to Git connection issues. Please check your configuration and try again`.

This error can occur if there are issues with your Git connection settings or permissions. To resolve the error, verify that:

- Your credentials have write access to the Git repository, as Segment requires this to sync changes.
- Your repository is hosted by GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket (Segment doesn't support self-hosted repositories).
- Branch protections are disabled on the repository, or you're using the Segment GitHub app integration and have allowlisted the integration to bypass your branch protection rules.
