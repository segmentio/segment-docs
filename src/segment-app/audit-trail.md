title: "Audit Trail"
---

Segment offers an in-app Audit Trail for Business Tier and Enterprise accounts. If you are a workspace Owner, you view user and system activity in your workspace settings, in the "Audit Trail" tab under "Admin".

You can filter for specific actions or actors to see who made changes on specific resources in the app. Actors can include both logged-in users as well as access tokens. You can export the information to a CSV for download, or forward the activity to a Segment source. For example, you can forward audit trail activity to set up real-time Slack alerts and quickly revert changes that could cause unwanted downstream effects, such as a user unintentionally disabling a warehouse.

The Audit Trail includes information on the following activity:
