title: Roles
---

A role gives a user access to resources within a workspace. Roles are additive, and can combine to configure a custom policy for a Team Member or a Group. A policy is at least one role plus one resource applied to an individual user or group.

## Global Roles

All Segment workspaces have the following roles, regardless of account type.

| Role                | Details                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

## PII Access

The Segment App doesn't show detected Personally Identifiable Information (PII) to workspace members if the information matches specific expected formats for PII. When PII Access turns *off*, detected PII is masked based on [red or yellow default matchers](/docs/privacy/portal/#default-pii-matchers) and any [custom matchers](/docs/privacy/portal/#custom-pii-matchers) defined in the Privacy Portal.

Workspace Owners can grant specific individuals or groups access to PII from their Access Management settings. PII Access only applies to the resources a user or user group has access to; it doesn't expand a user's access beyond the original scope. All Workspace Owners have PII access by default.


## Roles for managing Engage destinations

Engage destinations aren't included in the Engage roles by default. Users with Engage roles (including the Engage Admin) need additional permissions for each Engage space they work with to manage that Engage space's destinations.

Grant these users `Source Admin` on the source named `Engage (space name)` to grant them access to the Engage destinations for that Engage space.

## Roles for connecting resources

To connect two resource instances, you must have access to both. You can either grant this access to all resources, or to the specific resources you want to connect.

**To connect a source to warehouse** you must have `Source Admin` and `Warehouse Admin` access for the source and the warehouse.

**To connect source to tracking plan** requires `Source Admin` and `Tracking Plan Admin` access for the source and the tracking plan.

## Roles for Protocols Transformations

To **view** transformations, you need `Source Read-only`, either for all Sources or the specific Sources using Protocols.

To **create or edit** transformations you must have either `Source Admin` for all Sources, or for the specific Sources used with Protocols.
