title: Support Access
---
To best assist you after you submit a support ticket, Segment's Customer Success Engineers may request temporary access to your workspace. Once you grant access to your workspace, CSEs can access your workspace for up to 7 days, or until you revoke access.

> info ""
> Support Access is not available for workspaces using forced-SSO at this time.

## Granting a Segment Support Engineer access to your account
Support Access is available for all Segment Workspace Owners and can be found on the **Support Access** tab of the  [Workspace Settings](https://app.segment.com/goto-my-workspace/settings/support-access) page.

Click **Grant Access** to allow a Segment Support Engineer to access your account.


## Support privileges

When you grant Support Access, the Segment Support Engineers can do everything that you can do in your workspace.

## How do I know it's working?

Workspace Owners of Business Tier workspaces can view any Support Access actions in the [Audit Trail](/docs/segment-app/iam/audit-trail). You can see and monitor:

- **Support Access Granted** - you enabled Support Access in your Workspace Settings
- **Support Login** - a Segment Support Engineer accessed your workspace with your account
- **Support Access Revoked**  - you revoked Support Access from your account
