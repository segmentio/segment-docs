     full force and effect. If there is any conflict between this

### 4. Scope of this Addendum

This Addendum applies to Segment's Processing of Customer Personal
Data under the Agreement, except that [Annex A](#annex-a-eu-annex) (EU
Annex) to this Addendum applies only to such Processing of Customer
Personal Data governed by EU Data Protection Law and [Annex B](#annex-b-california-annex) (California Annex) to this Addendum applies only to
such Processing of Customer Personal Data governed by the CCPA.

### 5. Role and Scope of the Processing

5.1.  Segment will Process Customer Data only in accordance with
      Customer's instructions. By entering into the Agreement, Customer
      instructs Segment to Process Customer Data to provide the Services
      and pursuant to any other written instructions given by Customer and
      acknowledged in writing by Segment as constituting instructions for
      purposes of this Addendum. Customer acknowledges and agrees that
      such instruction authorizes Segment to Process Customer Data (a) to
      perform its obligations and exercise its rights under the Agreement;
      and (b) to perform its legal obligations and to establish, exercise
      or defend legal claims in respect of the Agreement.

5.2.  For clarity, nothing in this Addendum limits Segment from
      transmitting Customer Data to and among Sources and Destinations as
      directed by Customer through the Services. The parties agree that
      neither Sources nor Destinations are Subprocessors of Segment and
      that, between the parties, Customer is solely responsible for the
      Processing of Customer Personal Data by, and other acts and
      omissions of, Sources and Destinations or parties associated
      therewith.

### 6. Subprocessing

6.1.  Customer specifically authorizes Segment to use its Affiliates as
      Subprocessors, and generally authorizes Segment to engage Third
      Party Subprocessors to Process Customer Personal Data. Segment:

  6.1.1.  shall enter into a written agreement with each Subprocessor,
          imposing data protection obligations substantially similar to those
          set out in this Addendum; and
  6.1.2.  remains liable for compliance with the obligations of this Addendum
          and for any acts or omissions of the Subprocessor that cause Segment
              to breach any of its obligations under this Addendum.

6.2.  A list of Segment's Subprocessors, including their functions and
      locations, is available at
      [https://segment.com/docs/legal/subprocessors/](https://segment.com/docs/legal/subprocessors/) or such other
      website as Segment may designate ("Subprocessor Page"), and may be
      updated by Segment from time to time in accordance with this
      Addendum.

6.3.  When any new Third Party Subprocessor is engaged, Segment will
      notify Customer of the engagement, which notice may be given by
      updating the Subprocessor Page and via a message through Customer's
      Segment Workspace. Segment will give such notice at least ten (10)
      calendar days before the new Subprocessor Processes any Customer
      Personal Data, except that if Segment reasonably believes engaging a
      new Subprocessor on an expedited basis is necessary to protect the
      confidentiality, integrity or availability of the Customer Personal
      Data or avoid material disruption to the Services, Segment will give
      such notice as soon as reasonably practicable. If, within five (5)
      calendar days after such notice, Customer notifies Segment in
      writing that Customer objects to Segment's appointment of a new
      Third Party Subprocessor based on reasonable data protection
      concerns, the parties will discuss such concerns in good faith and
      whether they can be resolved. If the parties are not able to
      mutually agree to a resolution of such concerns, Customer, as its
      sole and exclusive remedy, may terminate the Agreement for
      convenience.

### 7. Security

7.1.  Segment shall implement and maintain technical and organizational
      security measures designed to protect Customer Personal Data from
      Security Incidents and to preserve the security and confidentiality
      of the Customer Personal Data, in accordance with Segment's security
      standards referenced in the Agreement ("**Security Measures**").

7.2.  Customer is responsible for reviewing the information made available
      by Segment relating to data security and making an independent
      determination as to whether the Services meet Customer's
      requirements and legal obligations under Data Protection Laws.
      Customer acknowledges that the Security Measures may be updated from
      time to time upon reasonable notice to Customer to reflect process
      improvements or changing practices (but the modifications will not
      materially decrease Segment's obligations as compared to those
      reflected in such terms as of the Effective Date).

7.3.  Upon becoming aware of a confirmed Security Incident, Segment shall
      notify Customer without undue delay unless prohibited by applicable
      law. A delay in giving such notice requested by law enforcement
      and/or in light of Segment's legitimate needs to investigate or
      remediate the matter before providing notice shall not constitute an
      undue delay. Such notices will describe, to the extent possible,
      details of the Security Incident, including steps taken to mitigate
      the potential risks and steps Segment recommends Customer take to
      address the Security Incident. Without prejudice to Segment's
      obligations under this Section 7.c., Customer is solely responsible
      for complying with Security Incident notification laws applicable to
      Customer and fulfilling any third party notification obligations
      related to any Security Incidents. Segment's notification of or
      response to a Security Incident under this Section 7.c. will not be
      construed as an acknowledgement by Segment of any fault or liability
      with respect to the Security Incident.

7.4.  Customer agrees that, without limitation of Segment's obligations
      under this Section 7, Customer is solely responsible for its use of
      the Services, including (a) making appropriate use of the Services
      to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk in respect of
      the Customer Data; (b) securing the account authentication
      credentials, systems and devices Customer uses to access the
      Services; (c) securing Customer's systems and devices that it uses
      with the Services; and (d) maintaining its own backups of Customer
      Data.

### 8. Data Subject Requests

Segment shall upon Customer's request (and at Customer's expense)
provide Customer with such assistance as it may reasonably require
to comply with its obligations under Data Protection Laws to respond
to requests from individuals to exercise their rights under Data
Protection Laws (e.g., rights of data access, rectification,
erasure, restriction, portability and objection) in cases where
Customer cannot reasonably fulfill such requests independently by
using the self-service functionality of the Services. If Segment
receives a request from a Data Subject in relation to their Customer
Personal Data, Segment will advise the Data Subject to submit their
request to Customer, and Customer will be responsible for responding
to any such request.

### 9. Return or Deletion of Data

9.1.  Segment shall, within sixty (60) days after request by Customer
      following the termination or expiration of the Agreement, delete all
      of the Customer Personal Data from Segment's systems.

9.2.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, Customer understands that Segment may
      retain Customer Personal Data if required by law, which data will
      remain subject to the requirements of this Addendum.

## Annex A - EU Annex

### 1.  Definitions; Processing of Data


1.1.  **Definitions**. For purposes of this [Annex A](#annex-a-eu-annex), the terms
      "**controller**", "**processor**" and "**supervisory authority**" have the
      meanings given in EU Data Protection Law; "**Standard Contractual
      Clauses**" means the Standard Contractual Clauses for Processors as
      approved by the European Commission under Decision 2010/87/EU in the
      form made accessible in Customer's Segment Workspace; and "**data importer**" and "**data exporter**" have the meanings given in the
      Standard Contractual Clauses.

1.2.  **Subject Matter and Details of Processing**. The parties acknowledge
      and agree that (a) the subject matter of the Processing under the
      Agreement is Segment's provision of the Services; (b) the duration
      of the Processing is from Segment's receipt of Customer Personal
      Data until deletion of all Customer Personal Data by Segment in
      accordance with the Agreement; (c) the nature and purpose of the
      Processing is to provide the Services; (d) the Data Subjects to whom
      the Processing pertains are Customer's customers, end users or other
      individuals to whom Customer Personal Data pertains; and (e) the
      categories of Customer Personal Data are such categories as Customer
      is authorized to ingest into the Services under the Agreement.

1.3.  **Roles and Regulatory Compliance; Authorization**. The parties
      acknowledge and agree that (a) Segment is a processor of the
      Customer Personal Data under EU Data Protection Law; (b) Customer is
      a controller of the Customer Personal Data under EU Data Protection
      Law; and (c) each party will comply with the obligations applicable
      to it in such role under EU Data Protection Law with respect to the
      Processing of Customer Personal Data. To the extent that any Usage
      Data (as defined in the Agreement) is considered Personal Data,
      Segment is the controller with respect to such data and shall
      Process such data in accordance with its Privacy Policy, which can
      be found at [segment.com/docs/legal/privacy](/docs/legal/privacy).

1.4.  Segment's Compliance with Instructions. Segment will only Process
      Customer Personal Data in accordance with Customer's instructions in
      this Addendum unless EU Data Protection Law requires otherwise, in
      which case Segment will notify Customer (unless that law prohibits
      Segment from doing so).

### 2. Data Security

2.1.  **Segment Security Measures, Controls and Assistance**

2.1.1.  Segment will (taking into account the nature of the Processing of
        Customer Personal Data and the information available to Segment)
        provide Customer with reasonable assistance necessary for Customer
        to comply with its obligations in respect of Customer Personal Data
        under EU Data Protection Law, including Articles 32 to 34
        (inclusive) of the GDPR, by (a) implementing and maintaining the
        Security Measures; (b) complying with the terms of Section 7 of this
        Addendum; and (c) complying with this [Annex A](#annex-a-eu-annex).

2.1.2.  Segment will grant access to Customer Personal Data only to
        personnel who need such access for the scope of their job duties,
        and are subject to appropriate confidentiality obligations. Should
        an employee of a Customer seek to exercise their rights under EU
        Data Protection Laws (e.g., rights of data access, rectification,
        erasure, restriction, portability and objection) in respect of any
        Usage Data that constitutes Personal Data then the Customer
        undertakes to inform Segment without delay and instruct their
        employee to contact Segment directly via [privacy@segment.com](mailto:privacy@segment.com) or
        such other email address as directed at the time.

2.2.  **Audits and Reviews of Compliance**. To the extent applicable Data
      Protection Laws include a right for Customer to audit Segment's
      Processing of Customer Personal Data, Customer will exercise such
      audit right, and Segment will fulfill its corresponding obligations,
      as follows:

  2.2.1.  Segment shall make available to Customer relevant information
          regarding Segment's Processing of Customer Personal Data under this
          Addendum in the form of Segment's most recent ISO 27001, ISO 27017
          or ISO 27018 certifications or similar audit reports ("**Third Party Reports**").

  2.2.2.  Not more than once per calendar year and at Customer's expense,
          Customer may audit Segment's Processing of Customer Personal Data
          for compliance with its obligations under this Addendum by
          submitting reasonable requests for information, including security
          and audit questionnaires. Segment will provide written responses to
          the extent the requested information is necessary to confirm
          Segment's compliance with this Addendum. However, if the requested
          information is addressed in a Third Party Report issued within the
          12-month period prior to Customer's request and Segment confirms
          there have been no material changes in the interim relevant to
          Customer's request, Customer agrees to accept such Third Party
          Report in lieu of a written response. Any information provided by
          Segment under this Section 2.b. constitutes Segment's Confidential
          Information under the Agreement.

  2.2.3.  If a third party is to conduct an audit under this Section 2.b.,
          Segment may object to the auditor if the auditor is, in Segment's
          reasonable opinion, not independent, a competitor of Segment or
          otherwise unqualified. Such objection by Segment will require
          Customer to appoint another auditor or conduct the audit itself.

  2.2.4.  Customer will promptly notify Segment of any non-compliance
          discovered during the course of an audit and provide Segment any
          audit reports generated in connection with any audit under this
          Section 2.b., unless prohibited by EU Data Protection Law or
          otherwise instructed by a supervisory authority. Customer may use
          the audit reports only for the purposes of meeting Customer's
          regulatory audit requirements and confirming that Segment's
          Processing of Customer Personal Data complies with this Addendum.

  2.2.5.  Customer shall reimburse Segment for any time expended by Segment or
          its Subprocessors in connection with any audits under this Section
          2.b. at Segment's then-current professional services rates, which
          shall be made available to Customer upon request. Customer will be
          responsible for any fees charged by any auditor appointed by
          Customer to execute any such audit. Nothing in this Addendum shall
          be construed to require Segment to furnish more information about
          its Third Party Subprocessors in connection with such audits than
          such Third Party Subprocessors make generally available to their
          customers. Nothing in this Section 2.b. shall require Segment to
          breach any duties of confidentiality.

### 3. Impact Assessments and Consultations

Segment may (taking into account the nature of the Processing and the
information available to Segment) reasonably assist Customer in
complying with Customer's obligations under Articles 35 and 36 of the
GDPR, by (a) making available documentation describing relevant aspects
of Segment's information security program and the security measures
applied in connection therewith; and (b) providing the other information
contained in the Agreement, including this Addendum.

### 4. Data Transfers

4.1.  **Data Processing Facilities**. Segment may, subject to Section 4.b.,
      store and Process Customer Personal Data in the United States or
      anywhere Segment or its Subprocessors maintain facilities. Subject
      to Segment's obligations in this Section 4, Customer is responsible
      for ensuring that its use of the Services complies with any
      cross-border data transfer restrictions of EU Data Protection Law.

4.2.  **Privacy Shield**. To the extent that Segment Processes any Customer
      Personal Data of individuals in the EU or Switzerland in the United
      States, then Segment shall protect such Customer Personal Data in
      accordance with the Privacy Shield Principles and Supplemental
      Principles of the EU-U.S. and Swiss Privacy Shield Frameworks
      ("Privacy Shield"). If Segment is unable to comply with this
      requirement, Segment shall inform Customer.

4.3.  **Standard Contractual Clauses**. If Customer is established in the EU
      and transfers Customer Personal Data out of the EU to Segment in a
      country not deemed by the European Commission to have adequate data
      protection, and the Privacy Shield ceases to be a basis by which
      Customer may lawfully make such transfer to Segment under Chapter V
      of the GDPR, and no lawful alternative basis for such transfer
      applies, such transfer will be governed by the Standard Contractual
      Clauses, the terms of which are hereby incorporated into this DPA.
      In furtherance of the foregoing, the parties agree that:

  4.3.1.  for purposes of the Standard Contractual Clauses, (a) Customer will
          act as the data exporter and (b) Segment will act as the data
          importer;

  4.3.2.  for purposes of Appendix 1 to the Standard Contractual Clauses, the
          Data Subjects, categories of data, and the processing operations
          shall be as set out in Section 1.b. to this [Annex A](#annex-a-eu-annex);

  4.3.3.  for purposes of Appendix 2 to the Standard Contractual Clauses, the
          technical and organizational measures shall be the Security
          Measures;

  4.3.4.  upon data exporter's request under the Standard Contractual Clauses,
          data importer will provide the copies of the Subprocessor agreements
          that must be sent by the data importer to the data exporter pursuant
          to Clause 5(j) of the Standard Contractual Clauses, and data
          importer may remove or redact all commercial information or clauses
          unrelated to the Standard Contractual Clauses or their equivalent
          beforehand;

  4.3.5.  the audits described in Clause 5(f) and Clause 12(2) of the Standard
          Contractual Clauses shall be performed in accordance with Section
          2.b. of this [Annex A](#annex-a-eu-annex);

  4.3.6.  Customer's authorizations in Section 6 of this Addendum
          (Subprocessing) will constitute Customer's prior written consent to
          the subcontracting by Segment of the Processing of Customer Personal
          Data if such consent is required under Clause 5(h) of the Standard
          Contractual Clauses;

  4.3.7.  certification of deletion of Customer Personal Data as described in
          Clause 12(1) of the Standard Contractual Clauses shall be provided
          only upon Customer's request; and

  4.3.8.  the Standard Contractual Clauses shall automatically terminate once
          the Customer Personal Data transfer governed thereby becomes lawful
          under Chapter V of the GDPR in the absence of such Standard
          Contractual Clauses on any other basis.
