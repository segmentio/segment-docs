## SEGMENT TERMS OF SERVICE

These Segment Terms of Service (this "**Agreement**") is entered into by
and between Segment.io, Inc. ("**Segment**") and the entity or person placing an order for or accessing the Services
("**Customer**" or "**you**"). This Agreement consists of the terms and
conditions set forth below, any exhibits or addenda identified below and
any ordering documents, online registration, order descriptions or order
confirmations referencing this Agreement ("**Order Forms**"). If you are
accessing or using the Services on behalf of your company, you represent
that you are authorized to accept this Agreement on behalf of your
company, and all references to "you" or "Customer" reference your
company.

The "**Effective** **Date**" of this Agreement is the date which is the
earlier of (a) Customer's initial access to the Services (as defined
below) through any online provisioning, registration or order process or
(b) the effective date of the first Order Form referencing this
Agreement. This Agreement will govern Customer's initial purchase on the
Effective Date as well as any future purchases made by Customer that
reference this Agreement.

**Modifications**: You acknowledge and agree that Segment may modify the
terms and conditions of this Agreement in accordance with Section 12
(Modifications).

**BY INDICATING YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT OR ACCESSING OR USING THE SERVICES, YOU ARE AGREEING TO BE BOUND BY ALL TERMS, CONDITIONS AND NOTICES CONTAINED OR REFERENCED IN THIS AGREEMENT. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THIS AGREEMENT, PLEASE DO NOT USE THE SERVICES. FOR CLARITY, EACH PARTY EXPRESSLY AGREES THAT THIS AGREEMENT IS LEGALLY BINDING UPON IT.**

### 1.  **SEGMENT SERVICES.**

Segment offers a suite of Services for data
integration, data governance and audience management, as further
described below and in the Documentation.

1.1.  **Overview**.
Segment's "**Connections**" Service acts as a
central hub for Customer Data, allowing Customer to collect
Customer Data from its selected sources ("**Sources**"), such as
its own or third-party websites or properties, and send the
Customer Data to Customer's chosen destinations
("**Destinations**"), such as Customer's databases or its
accounts with third-party applications or services, for
Customer's further use. The supported Sources and Destinations
are identified in the Documentation. For Sources owned or
controlled by Customers ("**Customer Properties**"), Customer
enables the collection of Customer Data by implementing
Segment's JavaScript, SDK or other code ("**Segment Code**") on
such Customer Properties.  As further described below and in the
Documentation, Customer maintains control over which Sources and
Destinations it uses with the Services, as well as the types and
content of Customer Data it shares between its Sources and
Destinations.

1.2.  **Additional Services**. If included on an Order Form, Customer
may also receive access to additional Segment services that may
be used with Connections (e.g. Personas or Protocols). The
features of any additional services are further described in the
applicable Order Form. For clarity, any additional services are
considered part of the Services for purposes of this Agreement.

1.3.  **Definitions**

"**Customer Data**" means any data that Customer submits to the
Services, including data that it collects from Customer Properties or
retrieves from other Sources through the Services, including as may be
incorporated in any Customer reports or output generated by the
Services. Customer Data does not, however, include any Segment or
third-party templates, technology or data.

"**Documentation**" means the end user technical documentation provided
with the Services, as may be modified from time to time.

"**Laws**" means all applicable local, state, federal and international
laws, regulations and conventions, including those related to data
privacy and data transfer, international communications, and the
exportation of technical or personal data.

"**Sensitive Personal Information**" means any of the following: (i)
credit, debit or other payment card data subject to the Payment Card
Industry Data Security Standards ("**PCI DSS**"), or other financial
account numbers or credentials; (ii) patient, medical or other protected
health information regulated by the Health Insurance Portability and
Accountability Act ("**HIPAA**"); (iii) social security numbers,
driver's license numbers or other government ID numbers; (iv) any
information deemed to be "special categories of data" of an EU resident
(as defined in European Union Regulation 2016/679); or (v) other
personal or sensitive information subject to regulation or protection
under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, Children's Online Privacy Protection
Act or similar foreign or domestic Laws.

"**Service(s)**" means the specific Segment proprietary hosted
service(s) (e.g. Connections, Protocols, Personas) specified on an Order
Form, including any related Segment dashboards, APIs and Segment Code.

"**Usage Data**" means Segment's technical logs, account and login data,
data and learnings about Customer's use of the Services (e.g., frequency
of logins, volume of Customer Data collected or sent to Destinations). 
For clarity, Usage Data does not include Customer Data.

1.4.  **Provision of the Services**. The Services are provided on a
subscription basis for a set term designated on the Order Form
(each, a "**Subscription Term**") unless otherwise specified in
Section 2 (Service Plans and Beta Releases). Customer shall purchase
and Segment shall provide the Services as specified in the
applicable Order Form.

1.5.  **Access to the Services**. During the Subscription Term (as defined
below), Customer may access and use the Services for its internal
business operations, subject to this Agreement, the Documentation,
and any scope of use restrictions on the applicable Order Form. 
This includes the right to implement Segment Code on Customer
Properties in order to collect Customer Data for use with the
Services. Access to the Services is limited to Customer's employees
and contractors acting for the sole benefit of Customer
("**Permitted Users**"). Customer and its Permitted Users may need
to register for a Segment account in order to access or use the
Services. Account registration information must be accurate, current
and complete, and will be governed by Segment's Privacy Policy
(currently available at <https://segment.com/docs/legal/privacy/>).
Customer is responsible for any use of the Services by its Permitted
Users and their compliance with this Agreement.  Customer shall keep
confidential its user IDs and passwords for the Services and remain
responsible for any actions taken through its accounts.

1.6.  **Use Restrictions**. Customer shall not (and shall not permit any
third party to): (a) rent, lease, provide access to or sublicense
the Services to a third party; (b) use the Services to provide, or
incorporate the Services into, any product or service provided to a
third party; (c) use the Services to develop a similar or competing
product or service; (d) reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, or
otherwise seek to obtain the source code or non-public APIs to the
Services, except to the extent expressly permitted by applicable law
(and then only upon advance notice to Segment); (e) copy, modify or
create any derivative work of the Services or any Documentation; (f)
remove or obscure any proprietary or other notices contained in the
Services (including any reports or data printed from the Services);
or (g) publicly disseminate performance information regarding the
Services.

1.7.  **Storage and Processing of Customer Data**. During each
Subscription Term, Segment may store certain Customer Data submitted
from Sources to enable various features and functionality of the
Services, including for "replay" and re-sending of Customer Data to
Destinations at Customer's direction. Customer acknowledges that
Customer Data transmitted through the Services may be stored and
processed by Segment in the United States or in other countries as
approved or directed by Customer (e.g., through Customer's selection
of a regional option through the Services). For clarity, nothing in
this Section 1.6 prohibits Segment from transmitting Customer Data
to Customer's designated Destinations as part of the Services.

1.8.  **Data Protection Addendum**. The parties agree to comply with the
terms of the Data Protection Addendum attached as [Exhibit B](#exhibit-b---data-protection-addendum).

### 2.  **SERVICE PLANS AND BETA RELEASES**

2.1.  **Services Plans**. Segment makes available the Services through
paid plans ("**Paid Plans**"), a free "Developer" plan
("**Developer Plan**") and trial plans ("**Trial Plans**").
Current plans are described at [https://segment.com/pricing](https://segment.com/pricing) and
Customer's specific plan will be identified in the Order Form
presented when Customer registers, orders or pays for the
Services. Customer's permitted scope of use (such as features
available, permitted number of monthly tracked users (MTUs) and
other usage limits) depends on the plan that Customer selects
and will be specified on the applicable Order Form.

2.2.  **Paid Plans**. Paid Plans are provided for the Subscription
Term designated on the applicable Order Form and, unless
otherwise specified on the Order Form, each Subscription Term
shall automatically renew for the same period as the
then-current Subscription Term unless either party gives the
other written notice of termination at least thirty (30) days
prior to expiration of the then-current Subscription Term (e.g.,
monthly Paid Plans will automatically roll over month-to-month
and annual Paid Plans will automatically renew for additional
12-month periods).

2.3.  **Developer Plans and Trial Plans**

a.  **Developer Plans**. Under Developer Plans,
Customer may use the Services, and the Subscription Term is
ongoing until either (a) Segment or Customer terminate this
Agreement or (b) Segment ceases to offer the Developer Plan,
whichever occurs first.

b.  **Trial Plans**. Under Trial Plans, Customer may
use the Services solely to determine whether to purchase a
Paid Plan, and the Subscription Term will be thirty (30)
days unless otherwise specified in the Order Form. If
Customer does not upgrade from a Trial Plan to a Paid Plan
at the end of the Subscription Term, then Customer's access
to the Services may be limited or suspended (to be
determined at Segment's sole discretion) until such time as
Customer terminates this Agreement or converts to a Paid
Plan.

c.  **Special Terms**. Developer Plans and Trial Plans
may not include all features or functionality offered as
part of Paid Plans, and Segment reserves the right to add or
subtract any features or functionality at any time for such
plans. Segment has the right to suspend or terminate a
Developer Plan or Trial Plan at any time for any reason.

2.4.  **Beta Releases**. Customer may receive access to a Service (or
Service features) as an alpha, beta or early access offering
("**Beta Releases**"). Segment identifies all Beta Releases as
such and any usage by Customer is optional. Use of a Beta
Release is permitted only for Customer's internal evaluation
during the period designated by Segment (or if not designated,
30 days) and may be subject to additional terms provided by
Segment and agreed by Customer. Segment may suspend or terminate
Customer's access to Beta Releases at any time for any reason.
Beta Releases may be inoperable, incomplete or include features
that Segment may never release, and their features and
performance information are Segment's Confidential Information.
**Notwithstanding anything else in this Agreement, Segment's
liability for Beta Releases will not exceed US\$50.**

### 3.  **CUSTOMER OBLIGATIONS**

3.1.  **Data Collection**. Subject to this Agreement and as further
described in the Documentation, Customer may configure the
Customer Data elements to be collected from Sources and shared
with different Destinations. In some instances, as referenced in
the Services dashboard and Documentation, enabling a third-party
Destination involves implementing the third-party provider's own
SDK or code on Customer Properties. As a result, in these cases,
certain default data designated by that Destination's provider
may be sent directly to Customer's accounts with that
Destination, rather than passing through the Services.

3.2.  **Rights in Customer Data**. Customer is solely responsible for
the accuracy, content and legality of all Customer Data.
Customer represents and warrants to Segment that (1) Customer
will comply with all applicable Laws in its use of the Services
(including, if applicable, the California Online Privacy
Protection Act, European Union Regulation 2016/679 and similar
Laws governing cross-site tracking or automated decision-making)
and (2) Customer has provided all disclosures and obtained all
necessary rights, consents and permissions to collect, share and
use Customer Data as contemplated in this Agreement (including
granting Segment the rights in Section 5.1 and Customer's
building, tracking, using or sharing of any user profiles,
traits or audiences), without violation or infringement of (i)
any third party intellectual property, publicity, privacy or
other rights, (ii) any Laws, or (iii) any terms of service,
privacy policies or other agreement governing the Customer
Properties or Customer's accounts with third-party Sources or
Destinations. By enabling use of the Services with any Source or
Destination, Customer authorizes Segment to access Customer's
accounts with such Source or Destination for the purposes
described in this Agreement. In addition, in order to provide
the Services to Customer and improve Segment's integrations with
Sources and Destinations, Segment may also disclose Customer's
status as a Segment customer and related technical Services data
to the providers of Customer's Sources and Destinations.

3.3.  **No Sensitive Personal Information**. Customer specifically
agrees not to use the Services to collect, store, process or
transmit any Sensitive Personal Information. Customer
acknowledges that Segment is not a Business Associate or
subcontractor (as those terms are defined in HIPAA) or a payment
card processor and that the Services is neither HIPAA nor PCI
DSS compliant. Segment shall have no liability under this
Agreement for Sensitive Personal Information, notwithstanding
anything to the contrary herein.

3.4.  **Indemnification by Customer**. Customer shall indemnify,
defend and hold harmless Segment from and against any and all
third-party claims, costs, damages, losses, liabilities and
expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and costs)
arising out of or in connection with any Customer Data or breach
or alleged breach by Customer of Sections 3.2 (Rights in
Customer Data) or 3.3 (No Sensitive Personal Information). This
indemnification obligation is subject to Customer receiving (i)
prompt written notice of such claim (but in any event notice in
sufficient time for Customer to respond without prejudice); (ii)
the exclusive right to control and direct the investigation,
defense, or settlement of such claim; and (iii) all reasonably
necessary cooperation of Segment (at Customer's expense for
reasonable out-of-pocket costs).

### 4.  **SECURITY**.
Segment agrees to use commercially reasonable
technical and organizational measures designed to prevent
unauthorized access, use, alteration or disclosure of the Services
or Customer Data, as further described in Segment's Information
Security Policy attached as [Exhibit A](#exhibit-a---information-security-policy). However,
Segment shall have no responsibility for errors in transmission,
unauthorized third-party access or other causes beyond Segment's
control.

### 5.  **OWNERSHIP**

5.1.  **Customer Data**. As between the parties, Customer shall retain
all right, title and interest (including any and all
intellectual property rights) in and to the Customer Data as
provided to Segment. Subject to the terms of this Agreement,
Customer hereby grants to Segment a non-exclusive, worldwide,
royalty-free right to use, copy, store, transmit, modify, create
derivative works of and display the Customer Data solely to the
extent necessary to provide the Services to Customer during the
Subscription Term.

5.2.  **Segment Technology**. This is a subscription agreement for
access to and use of the Services. Customer agrees that Segment
or its suppliers retain all right, title and interest (including
all patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret and other
intellectual property rights) in and to the Services, all
Documentation and any and all related and underlying technology
and documentation and any derivative works, modifications or
improvements of any of the foregoing, including as may
incorporate Feedback (as defined below). Segment may generate
Usage Data to operate, improve, analyze and support the
Services, for benchmarking and reporting and for Segment's other
lawful business purposes. Except as expressly set forth in this
Agreement, no rights in the Services or any Segment technology
are granted to Customer.

5.3.  **Feedback**. Customer, from time to time, may submit comments,
questions, suggestions or other feedback relating to any Segment
product or service to Segment ("**Feedback**"). Segment may
freely use or exploit Feedback in connection with any of its
products or services.

### 6.  **FEES & PAYMENT**

6.1.  **Fees and Payment**. All fees for Paid Plans are as set forth
in the applicable Order Form and shall be paid by Customer in
accordance with the payment terms set forth in the Order Form.
If no payment terms are specified in the Order Form, then the
following default terms apply: (i) for monthly Subscription
Terms, Customer will pay all fees at the end of the month
and (ii) for annual Subscription Terms, Customer will pay all
fees within thirty (30) days of invoice. Except as expressly set
forth in Section 12.1 (Modifications to this Agreement), all
fees are non-refundable. Segment reserves the right to increase
the rates specified in the Order Form upon any renewal of a
Subscription Term. Any late payments shall be subject to a
service charge equal to 1.5% per month of the amount due or the
maximum amount allowed by law, whichever is less.

6.2.  **Taxes**. Segment's fees are exclusive of all taxes, levies, or
duties imposed by taxing authorities, including for example,
value-added, sales, use or withholding taxes, assessable by any
jurisdiction whatsoever (collectively, "**Taxes**") and Customer
shall be responsible for payment of all Taxes associated with
this Agreement and all Order Forms, except that Segment is
solely responsible for taxes assessable against Segment based on
Segment's net income, property, and employees. If any deduction
or withholding is required by law, Customer shall notify Segment
and shall pay Segment any additional amounts necessary to ensure
that the net amount that Segment receives, after any deduction
and withholding, equals the amount Segment would have received
if no deduction or withholding had been required.

6.3.  **Overages**. If Customer exceeds its permitted usage in any
month of a Subscription Term as specified in an Order Form,
Segment reserves the right to charge overage fees in respect of
such excess usage at the applicable overage rates set forth in
the Order Form. Customer will pay any overage fees monthly in
arrears.

### 7.  **TERM AND TERMINATION**

7.1.  **Term**. This Agreement is effective as of the Effective Date
and expires on the date of expiration or termination of all
Subscription Terms.

7.2.  **Termination for Cause**. Either party may terminate this
Agreement (including all related Order Forms) if the other
party (a) fails to cure any material breach of this Agreement
(including a failure to pay fees or comply with applicable scope
of use restrictions) within thirty (30) days after written
notice; (b) ceases operation without a successor; or (c) seeks
protection under any bankruptcy, receivership, trust deed,
creditors' arrangement, composition, or comparable proceeding,
or if any such proceeding is instituted against that party (and
not dismissed within sixty (60) days thereafter). For clarity,
nothing in this Section 7.2 limits Segment's right to terminate
or suspend any Developer Plan or Trial Plan as set forth in
Section 2.3 (Developer Plans and Trial Plans).

7.3.  **Suspension of Services**. Without limiting Segment's
termination or other rights hereunder, Segment reserves the
right to suspend Customer's access to the Services (and any
related services) in whole or in part, without liability to
Customer: (i) if Customer's account is thirty (30) days or more
overdue; (ii) for Customer's breach of Sections 1.5 (Use
Restrictions) or 3 (Customer Obligations); or (iii) to prevent
harm to other customers or third parties or to preserve the
security, availability or integrity of the Services. When
practicable, Segment will use reasonable efforts to provide
Customer with advance notice of the suspension (email
sufficing). Unless this Agreement has been terminated, Segment
will cooperate to restore Customer's access to the Services
promptly after Segment verifies that Customer has resolved the
issue requiring suspension.

7.4.  **Effect of Termination**. Upon any expiration or termination of
this Agreement, Customer shall immediately cease any and all use
of and access to the Services (including any and all related
Segment technology), cease distributing any Segment Code
installed on Customer Properties, and delete (or, at Segment's
request, return) any and all copies of the Documentation, any
Segment passwords or access codes and any other Segment
Confidential Information in its possession. Customer
acknowledges that following termination it shall have no further
access to any Customer Data in the Services, and that Segment
may delete any such data as may have been stored by Segment at
any time. Upon any expiration or termination of this Agreement,
Segment shall delete all Customer Data within sixty (60) days
after receipt of Customer's written request. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Customer understands that Segment may retain copies
of Customer Data in regular backups or as required by Laws,
which will remain subject to the security standards in Section 4
(Security). Except where an exclusive remedy is specified, the
exercise of either party of any remedy under this Agreement,
including termination, will be without prejudice to any other
remedies it may have under this Agreement, by law or otherwise.

7.5.  **Survival**. The following Sections shall survive any
expiration or termination of this Agreement: 1.5 (Use
Restrictions), the disclaimers in Section 2.4 (Beta Releases),
3.4 (Indemnification by Customer), 5 (Ownership), 6.1 (Fees and
Payment), 7 (Term and Termination), 8 (Warranty Disclaimer), 9
(Limitation of Remedies and Damages), 10 (Confidential
Information), 12 (Modifications) and 13 (General Terms).

### 8.  WARRANTY DISCLAIMER.
**THE SERVICES and ALL RELATED SERVICES ARE
PROVIDED "AS IS". NEITHER SEGMENT NOR ITS SUPPLIERS MAKES ANY OTHER
WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING
BUT NOT LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, TITLE, FITNESS FOR
A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NONINFRINGEMENT. Segment does not warrant
that Customer's use of THE SERVICEs will be uninterrupted or
error-free, nor does Segment warrant that it will review the
Customer Data for accuracy or that it will preserve or maintain the
Customer Data without loss. CUSTOMER UNDERSTANDS THAT CUSTOMER DATA
IS SHARED WITH DESTINATIONS AT CUSTOMER'S ELECTION AND SEGMENT TAKES
NO RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY DESTINATION'S USE OR PROTECTION OF
CUSTOMER DATA ONCE IT HAS BEEN SHARED. CUSTOMER UNDERSTANDS THAT IT
IS RESPONSIBLE FOR PUTTING IN PLACE ANY CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEMENTS
WITH DESTINATIONS REQUIRED BY LAWS. Segment SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR
DELAYS, INTERRUPTIONS, SERVICE FAILURES OR OTHER PROBLEMS INHERENT
IN USE OF THE INTERNET AND ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATIONS OR OTHER
SYSTEMS OUTSIDE THE REASONABLE CONTROL OF Segment. CUSTOMER MAY HAVE
OTHER STATUTORY RIGHTS, BUT THE DURATION OF STATUTORILY REQUIRED
WARRANTIES, IF ANY, SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE SHORTEST PERIOD
PERMITTED BY LAW.**

### 9.  **Limitation of Remedies and Damages**

9.1.  **Consequential Damages Waiver**. EXCEPT FOR EXCLUDED CLAIMS
(DEFINED BELOW), NEITHER PARTY (NOR ITS SUPPLIERS) SHALL HAVE
ANY LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT FOR
ANY LOSS OF USE, LOST DATA, LOST PROFITS, FAILURE OF SECURITY
MECHANISMS, INTERRUPTION OF BUSINESS, OR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL,
INCIDENTAL, RELIANCE, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND, EVEN
IF INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES IN ADVANCE.

9.2.  **Liability Cap**. SEGMENT'S (AND ITS SUPPLIERS') ENTIRE
LIABILITY TO CUSTOMER ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS
AGREEMENT SHALL NOT EXCEED THE AMOUNT ACTUALLY PAID OR PAYABLE
BY CUSTOMER TO SEGMENT DURING THE PRIOR TWELVE (12) MONTHS UNDER
THIS AGREEMENT.

9.3.  **Excluded Claims**. "**Excluded Claims**" means (a) any claim
arising from Customer's breach of Sections 1.5 (Use
Restrictions), 3.2 (Rights in Customer Data) or 3.3 (No
Sensitive Personal Information); or (b) any amounts payable to
third parties pursuant to Customer's indemnification obligations
under Section 3.4 (Indemnification by Customer).

9.4.  **Nature of Claims and Failure of Essential Purpose**. The
parties agree that the waivers and limitations specified in this
Section 9 apply regardless of the form of action, whether in
contract, tort (including negligence), strict liability or
otherwise and will survive and apply even if any limited remedy
specified in this Agreement is found to have failed of its
essential purpose.

### 10. **CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION**.

Each party (as "**Receiving Party**")
agrees that all code, inventions, know-how, business, technical and
financial information it obtains from the disclosing party
("**Disclosing Party**") constitute the confidential property of the
Disclosing Party ("**Confidential Information**"), provided that it
is identified as confidential at the time of disclosure or should be
reasonably known by the Receiving Party to be confidential or
proprietary due to the nature of the information disclosed and the
circumstances surrounding the disclosure. Any Segment technology,
performance information relating to the Services, and the terms and
conditions of this Agreement shall be deemed Confidential
Information of Segment without any marking or further designation.
Except as expressly authorized herein, the Receiving Party shall (1)
hold in confidence and not disclose any Confidential Information to
third parties and (2) not use Confidential Information for any
purpose other than fulfilling its obligations and exercising its
rights under this Agreement. The Receiving Party may disclose
Confidential Information to its employees, agents, contractors and
other representatives having a legitimate need to know (including,
for Segment, the subcontractors referenced in Section 13.10),
provided that such representatives are bound to confidentiality
obligations no less protective of the Disclosing Party than this
Section 10 and that the Receiving Party remains responsible for
compliance by any such representative with the terms of this
Section 10. The Receiving Party's confidentiality obligations shall
not apply to information that the Receiving Party can document: (i)
was rightfully in its possession or known to it prior to receipt of
the Confidential Information; (ii) is or has become public knowledge
through no fault of the Receiving Party; (iii) is rightfully
obtained by the Receiving Party from a third party without breach of
any confidentiality obligation; or (iv) is independently developed
by employees of the Receiving Party who had no access to such
information. The Receiving Party may make disclosures to the extent
required by law or court order, provided the Receiving Party
notifies the Disclosing Party in advance and cooperates in any
effort to obtain confidential treatment. The Receiving Party
acknowledges that disclosure of Confidential Information would cause
substantial harm for which damages alone would not be a sufficient
remedy, and therefore that upon any such disclosure by the Receiving
Party the Disclosing Party shall be entitled to seek appropriate
equitable relief in addition to whatever other remedies it might
have at law.

### 11. **CO-MARKETING**.
Customer agrees to participate in reasonable
marketing activities that promote the benefits of the Services to
other potential customers and to use of Customer's name and logo on
Segment's web site and in Segment promotional materials. Customer
agrees that Segment may disclose Customer as a customer of Segment.

### 12. **MODIFICATIONS**

12.1.  **Modifications to this Agreement**. Segment may modify the
terms and conditions of this Agreement (which may include
changes to Services pricing and plans) from time to time with
notice to Customer in accordance with Section 13.5 (Notice).

a.  [Developer Plans and Trial Plans]{.underline}. If Customer
has a Developer Plan or a Trial Plan, any modifications will
become effective immediately, and if Customer objects to the
modifications, its exclusive remedy is to terminate this
Agreement and cease using the Services.

b.  [Paid Plans](). If Customer has a Paid Plan, the following terms apply: Unless a shorter period
is specified by Segment (e.g., due to changes in the law or exigent
circumstances), the modifications become effective upon renewal of Customer's
current Subscription Term or entry into a new Order Form. If Segment specifies
that the modifications to the Agreement will take effect prior to Customer's
next renewal or order and Customer notifies Segment in writing of its objection
to the modifications within thirty (30) days after the date of such notice,
Segment (at its option and as Customer's exclusive remedy) will either: (a)
permit Customer to continue under the existing version of this Agreement until
expiration of the then-current Subscription Term (after which time the modified
Agreement will go into effect) or (b) allow Customer to terminate this Agreement
and receive a pro-rated refund of any fees Customer has pre-paid for use of the
Services for the terminated portion of the applicable Subscription Term.
Customer may be required to click to accept or otherwise agree to the modified
Agreement in order to continue using the Services, and, in any event, continued
use of the Services after the updated version of this Agreement goes into effect
will constitute Customer's acceptance of such updated version.

12.2.  **Changes to Policies**. In addition, Segment may modify the
security terms described in [Exhibit A](#exhibit-a---information-security-policy){.underline} (Information
Security Policy) from time to time to reflect process
improvements or changing practices (but the modifications will
not materially decrease Segment's obligations as compared to
those in such policies as of the Effective Date). Policy
modifications will apply automatically on the effective date
specified by Segment and the Customer objection procedures in
Section 12.1 (Modifications to this Agreement) will not apply.

### 13. **GENERAL TERMS**

13.1.  **Assignment**. This Agreement will bind and inure to the
benefit of each party's permitted successors and assigns.
Neither party may assign this Agreement without the advance
written consent of the other party, except that Segment may
assign this Agreement in connection with a merger,
reorganization, acquisition or other transfer of all or
substantially all of Segment's assets or voting securities. Any
attempt to transfer or assign this Agreement except as expressly
authorized under this Section 13.1 will be null and void.

13.2.  **Severability**. If any provision of this Agreement shall be
adjudged by any court of competent jurisdiction to be
unenforceable or invalid, that provision shall be limited to the
minimum extent necessary so that this Agreement shall otherwise
remain in effect.

13.3.  **Governing Law; Jurisdiction and Venue**. This Agreement shall
be governed by the laws of the State of California and the
United States without regard to conflicts of laws provisions
thereof, and without regard to the United Nations Convention on
the International Sale of Goods. The jurisdiction and venue for
actions related to the subject matter hereof shall be the state
and United States federal courts located in San Francisco,
California and both parties hereby submit to the personal
jurisdiction of such courts.

13.4.  **Attorneys' Fees and Costs**. The prevailing party in any
action to enforce this Agreement will be entitled to recover its
attorneys' fees and costs in connection with such action.

13.5.  **Notice**. Any notice or communication required or permitted
under this Agreement shall be in writing. If to Segment, notices
must be provided to the address set forth in Section 13.6
(Segment Contact Information), and shall be deemed to have been
received (i) if given by hand, immediately upon receipt; (ii) if
given by overnight courier service, the first business day
following dispatch or (iii) if given by registered or certified
mail, postage prepaid and return receipt requested, the second
business day after such notice is deposited in the mail. If to
Customer, Segment may provide notice to Customer's email address
on file or through the Services and such notices shall be deemed
to have been received upon delivery. Either party may update its
address with notice to the other party.

13.6.  **Segment Contact Information**. Any Customer notices, questions
or complaints regarding the Services should be sent to the
following address:
```
Segment.io, Inc.
100 California Street, Suite 700
San Francisco, CA 94111
```

13.7.  **Waivers**. No waiver will be implied from conduct or failure to
enforce or exercise rights under this Agreement, nor will any waiver
be effective unless in a writing signed by a duly authorized
representative on behalf of the party claimed to have waived.

13.8.  **Entire Agreement; Interpretation**. This Agreement is the complete
and exclusive statement of the mutual understanding of the parties
and supersedes and cancels all previous written and oral agreements
and communications relating to the subject matter of this Agreement.
No provision of any purchase order or other business form employed
by Customer will supersede the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, and any such document relating to this Agreement shall be

Customer acknowledges that the Services are on-line,
subscription-based products, and that in order to provide improved
customer experience Segment may make changes to the Services, and
Segment will update the applicable Documentation accordingly.

13.9.  **Force Majeure**. Neither party shall be liable to the other for
any delay or failure to perform any obligation under this Agreement
(except for a failure to pay fees) if the delay or failure is due to
unforeseen events that occur after the signing of this Agreement and
that are beyond the reasonable control of such party, such as a
strike, blockade, war, act of terrorism, riot, natural disaster,
failure or diminishment of power or telecommunications or data
networks or services, or refusal of a license by a government
agency.

13.10. **Subcontractors**. Segment may use the services of subcontractors
and permit them to exercise the rights granted to Segment in order

subcontractor with the terms of this Agreement and the overall
performance of the Services as required under this Agreement.

13.11. **Subpoenas**. Nothing in this Agreement prevents Segment from
disclosing Customer Data to the extent required by law, subpoenas,
or court orders, but Segment shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to notify Customer where permitted to do so.

13.12. **Independent Contractors**. The parties to this Agreement are
independent contractors. There is no relationship of partnership,
joint venture, employment, franchise or agency created hereby
between the parties. Neither party will have the power to bind the
other or incur obligations on the other party's behalf without the
other party's prior written consent.

13.13. **Export Control**. In its use of the Services, Customer agrees to
comply with all export and import laws and regulations of the United

## Exhibit A - INFORMATION SECURITY POLICY

**Introduction**

Segment considers protection of Customer Data a top priority. As further
described in this Segment Information Security Policy, Segment uses
commercially reasonable organizational and technical measures designed
to prevent unauthorized access, use, alteration or disclosure of
Customer Data stored on systems under Segment's control. Segment
maintains these security measures in accordance with ISO 27001, 27017
and 27018.

1.  **Customer Data and Management**. Segment limits its personnel's
    access to Customer Data as follows:

    1.1.  Requires unique user access authorization through secure logins
        and passwords, including multi-factor authentication for Cloud
        Hosting administrator access and individually-assigned Secure
        Socket Shell (SSH) keys for external engineer access;

    1.2.  Limits the Customer Data available to Segment personnel on a
        "need to know" basis;

    1.3.  Restricts access to Segment's production environment by Segment
        personnel on the basis of business need;

    1.4.  Encrypts user security credentials for production access; and

    1.5.  Prohibits Segment personnel from storing Customer Data on
        electronic portable storage devices such as computer laptops,
        portable drives and other similar devices.

    1.6.  Segment logically separates each of its customers' data and
        maintains measures designed to prevent Customer Data from being
        exposed to or accessed by other customers.

2.  **Data Encryption**. Segment provides industry-standard encryption
    for Customer Data as follows:

    2.1.  Implements encryption in transport and at rest;

    2.2.  Uses strong encryption methodologies to protect Customer Data,
        including AES 256-bit encryption for Customer Data stored in
        Segment's production environment; and

    2.3.  Encrypts all Customer Data located in cloud storage while at
        rest.

3.  **Network Security, Physical Security and Environmental Controls**

    3.1.  Segment uses firewalls, network access controls and other
        techniques designed to prevent unauthorized access to systems
        processing Customer Data.

    3.2.  Segment maintains measures designed to assess, test and apply
        security patches to all relevant systems and applications used
        to provide the Services.

    3.3.  Segment monitors privileged access to applications that process
        Customer Data, including cloud services.

    3.4.  The Services operate on Amazon Web Services ("**AWS**") and
        Google Cloud ("**GCS**") and are protected by the security and
        environmental controls of Amazon and Google, respectively.
        Detailed information about AWS security is available at
        <https://aws.amazon.com/security/> and
        <http://aws.amazon.com/security/sharing-the-security-responsibility/>.

        <https://cloud.google.com/docs/tutorials#security>.

    3.5.  Customer Data stored within AWS or GCS is encrypted at all
        times. AWS and GCS do not have access to unencrypted Customer
        Data.

4.  **Independent Security Assessments**.
Segment periodically assesses the security of its systems and the Services as follows:

    4.1.  Annual detailed security and vulnerability assessments of the
    Services conducted by independent third-party security experts
    that include a code analysis and a comprehensive security
    review. Segment shall attest to Customer the date of the most
    recent security and vulnerability assessment at Customer's
    reasonable request.

    4.2.  Segment hires accredited third parties to perform audits and to
    attest to various compliance and certifications annually
    including ISO 27001, 27017, and 27018.

    4.3.  Bi-annual penetration testing of Segment systems and
    applications to test for exploits including, but not limited to,
    XSS, SQL injection, access controls, and CSRF.

    4.4.  Monthly vulnerability scanning.

5.  **Incident Response**.

    If Segment becomes aware of unauthorized
    access or disclosure of Customer Data under its control (a
    "**Breach**"), Segment will:

    5.1.  Take reasonable measures to mitigate the harmful effects of the
    Breach and prevent further unauthorized access or disclosure.

    5.2.  Upon confirmation of the Breach, notify Customer in writing of
    the Breach without undue delay. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
    Segment is not required to make such notice to the extent
    prohibited by Laws, and Segment may delay such notice as
    requested by law enforcement and/or in light of Segment's
    legitimate needs to investigate or remediate the matter before
    providing notice.

    5.3.  Each notice of a Breach will include:

    5.3.1.  The extent to which Customer Data has been, or is reasonably
    believed to have been, used, accessed, acquired or disclosed
    during the Breach;

    5.3.2.  A description of what happened, including the date of the
    Breach and the date of discovery of the Breach, if known;

    5.3.3.  The scope of the Breach, to the extent known; and

    disaster recovery plan.

    6.2.  Segment maintains processes to ensure failover redundancy with
    its systems, networks and data storage.

7.  **Personnel Management**

    7.1.  Segment performs employment verification, including proof of
    identity validation and criminal background checks for all new
    hires, including contract employees, in accordance with
    applicable law.

    7.2.  Segment provides training for its personnel who are involved in
    the processing of the Customer Data to ensure they do not
    collect, process or use Customer Data without authorization and
    that they keep Customer Data confidential, including following
    the termination of any role involving the Customer Data.

    7.3.  Segment conducts routine and random monitoring of employee
    systems activity.

    7.4.  Upon employee termination, whether voluntary or involuntary,

</ol>

<h3> 4. Scope of this Addendum</h3>

<p>This Addendum applies to Segment’s Processing of Customer Personal Data under the Agreement, except that <a href="#annex-a--eu-annex">Annex A</a> (EU Annex) to this Addendum applies only to such Processing of Customer Personal Data governed by EU Data Protection Law and <a href="#annex-b---california-annex">Annex B</a> (California Annex) to this Addendum applies only to such Processing of Customer Personal Data governed by the CCPA.</p>

<h3> 5. Role and Scope of the Processing</h3>

<ol id="lower-alpha">
<li><p>Segment will Process Customer Data only in accordance with Customer’s instructions. By entering into the Agreement, Customer instructs Segment to Process Customer Data to provide the Services and pursuant to any other written instructions given by Customer and acknowledged in writing by Segment as constituting instructions for purposes of this Addendum. Customer acknowledges and agrees that such instruction authorizes Segment to Process Customer Data (a) to perform its obligations and exercise its rights under the Agreement; and (b) to perform its legal obligations and to establish, exercise or defend legal claims in respect of the Agreement.</p></li>
<li><p>For clarity, nothing in this Addendum limits Segment from transmitting Customer Data to and among Sources and Destinations as directed by Customer through the Services. The parties agree that neither Sources nor Destinations are Subprocessors of Segment and that, between the parties, Customer is solely responsible for the Processing of Customer Personal Data by, and other acts and omissions of, Sources and Destinations or parties associated therewith.</p></li>
</ol>

<h3> 6. Subprocessing</h3>
<ol id="lower-alpha">
<li><p>Customer specifically authorizes Segment to use its Affiliates as Subprocessors, and generally authorizes Segment to engage Third Party Subprocessors to Process Customer Personal Data. Segment:</p></li>
  <ol id="lower-roman">
  <li><p>shall enter into a written agreement with each Subprocessor, imposing data protection obligations substantially similar to those set out in this Addendum; and</p></li>
  <li><p>remains liable for compliance with the obligations of this Addendum and for any acts or omissions of the Subprocessor that cause Segment to breach any of its obligations under this Addendum.</p></li>
  </ol>
<li><p>A list of Segment’s Subprocessors, including their functions and locations, is available at <a href="https://segment.com/docs/legal/subprocessors/">https://segment.com/docs/legal/subprocessors/</a> or such other website as Segment may designate (“<strong>"Subprocessor Page</strong>"”), and may be updated by Segment from time to time in accordance with this Addendum.</p></li>
<li><p>When any new Third Party Subprocessor is engaged, Segment will notify Customer of the engagement, which notice may be given by updating the Subprocessor Page and via a message through Customer’s Segment Workspace. Segment will give such notice at least ten (10) calendar days before the new Subprocessor Processes any Customer Personal Data, except that if Segment reasonably believes engaging a new Subprocessor on an expedited basis is necessary to protect the confidentiality, integrity or availability of the Customer Personal Data or avoid material disruption to the Services, Segment will give such notice as soon as reasonably practicable. If, within five (5) calendar days after such notice, Customer notifies Segment in writing that Customer objects to Segment’s appointment of a new Third Party Subprocessor based on reasonable data protection concerns, the parties will discuss such concerns in good faith and whether they can be resolved. If the parties are not able to mutually agree to a resolution of such concerns, Customer, as its sole and exclusive remedy, may terminate the Agreement for convenience.</p></li>
</ol>

<h3> 7. Security</h3>

<ol id="lower-alpha">
<li><p>Segment shall implement and maintain technical and organizational security measures designed to protect Customer Personal Data from Security Incidents and to preserve the security and confidentiality of the Customer Personal Data, in accordance with Segment’s security standards referenced in the Agreement ("<strong>Security Measures</strong>").</p></li>
<li><p>Customer is responsible for reviewing the information made available by Segment relating to data security and making an independent determination as to whether the Services meet Customer’s requirements and legal obligations under Data Protection Laws. Customer acknowledges that the Security Measures may be updated from time to time upon reasonable notice to Customer to reflect process improvements or changing practices (but the modifications will not materially decrease Segment’s obligations as compared to those reflected in such terms as of the Effective Date).</p></li>
<li><p>Upon becoming aware of a confirmed Security Incident, Segment shall notify Customer without undue delay unless prohibited by applicable law. A delay in giving such notice requested by law enforcement and/or in light of Segment’s legitimate needs to investigate or remediate the matter before providing notice shall not constitute an undue delay. Such notices will describe, to the extent possible, details of the Security Incident, including steps taken to mitigate the potential risks and steps Segment recommends Customer take to address the Security Incident. Without prejudice to Segment’s obligations under this Section 7.c., Customer is solely responsible for complying with Security Incident notification laws applicable to Customer and fulfilling any third party notification obligations related to any Security Incidents. Segment’s notification of or response to a Security Incident under this Section 7.c. will not be construed as an acknowledgement by Segment of any fault or liability with respect to the Security Incident.</p></li>
<li><p>Customer agrees that, without limitation of Segment’s obligations under this Section 7, Customer is solely responsible for its use of the Services, including (a) making appropriate use of the Services to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk in respect of the Customer Data; (b) securing the account authentication credentials, systems and devices Customer uses to access the Services; (c) securing Customer’s systems and devices that it uses with the Services; and (d) maintaining its own backups of Customer Data.</p></li>
</ol>

<h3> 8. Data Subject Requests</h3>
<p>Segment shall upon Customer’s request (and at Customer’s expense) provide Customer with such assistance as it may reasonably require to comply with its obligations under Data Protection Laws to respond to requests from individuals to exercise their rights under Data Protection Laws (e.g., rights of data access, rectification, erasure, restriction, portability and objection) in cases where Customer cannot reasonably fulfill such requests independently by using the self-service functionality of the Services. If Segment receives a request from a Data Subject in relation to their Customer Personal Data, Segment will advise the Data Subject to submit their request to Customer, and Customer will be responsible for responding to any such request.</p>

<h3> 9. Return or Deletion of Data</h3>
<ol id="lower-alpha">
<li><p>Segment shall, within sixty (60) days after request by Customer following the termination or expiration of the Agreement, delete all of the Customer Personal Data from Segment’s systems.</p></li>
<li><p>Notwithstanding the foregoing, Customer understands that Segment may retain Customer Personal Data if required by law, which data will remain subject to the requirements of this Addendum.</p></li>

</ol>

<h3> 2. Data Security</h3>

<ol id="lower-alpha">
  <li><p><strong>Segment Security Measures, Controls and Assistance</strong></p></li>
  <ol id="lower-roman">
    <li><p>Segment will (taking into account the nature of the Processing of Customer Personal Data and the information available to Segment) provide Customer with reasonable assistance necessary for Customer to comply with its obligations in respect of Customer Personal Data under EU Data Protection Law, including Articles 32 to 34 (inclusive) of the GDPR, by (a) implementing and maintaining the Security Measures; (b) complying with the terms of Section 7 of this Addendum; and (c) complying with this <a href="#annex-a--eu-annex">Annex A</a>.</p></li>
    <li><p>Segment will grant access to Customer Personal Data only to personnel who need such access for the scope of their job duties, and are subject to appropriate confidentiality obligations. Should an employee of a Customer seek to exercise their rights under EU Data Protection Laws (e.g., rights of data access, rectification, erasure, restriction, portability and objection) in respect of any Usage Data that constitutes Personal Data then the Customer undertakes to inform Segment without delay and instruct their employee to contact Segment directly via <a href="mailto:privacy@segment.com">privacy@segment.com</a> or such other email address as directed at the time.</p></li>
  </ol>
  <li><p><strong>Audits and Reviews of Compliance</strong>. To the extent applicable Data Protection Laws include a right for Customer to audit Segment’s Processing of Customer Personal Data, Customer will exercise such audit right, and Segment will fulfill its corresponding obligations, as follows:</p></li>
  <ol id="lower-roman">
    <li><p>Segment shall make available to Customer relevant information regarding Segment’s Processing of Customer Personal Data under this Addendum in the form of Segment’s most recent ISO 27001, ISO 27017 or ISO 27018 certifications or similar audit reports (“<strong>Third Party Reports</strong>”).</p></li>
    <li><p>Not more than once per calendar year and at Customer’s expense, Customer may audit Segment’s Processing of Customer Personal Data for compliance with its obligations under this Addendum by submitting reasonable requests for information, including security and audit questionnaires. Segment will provide written responses to the extent the requested information is necessary to confirm Segment’s compliance with this Addendum. However, if the requested information is addressed in a Third Party Report issued within the 12-month period prior to Customer’s request and Segment confirms there have been no material changes in the interim relevant to Customer’s request, Customer agrees to accept such Third Party Report in lieu of a written response. Any information provided by Segment under this Section 2.b. constitutes Segment’s Confidential Information under the Agreement.</p></li>
    <li><p>If a third party is to conduct an audit under this Section 2.b., Segment may object to the auditor if the auditor is, in Segment’s reasonable opinion, not independent, a competitor of Segment or otherwise unqualified. Such objection by Segment will require Customer to appoint another auditor or conduct the audit itself.</p></li>
    <li><p>Customer will promptly notify Segment of any non-compliance discovered during the course of an audit and provide Segment any audit reports generated in connection with any audit under this Section 2.b., unless prohibited by EU Data Protection Law or otherwise instructed by a supervisory authority. Customer may use the audit reports only for the purposes of meeting Customer’s regulatory audit requirements and confirming that Segment’s Processing of Customer Personal Data complies with this Addendum.</p></li>
    <li><p>Customer shall reimburse Segment for any time expended by Segment or its Subprocessors in connection with any audits under this Section 2.b. at Segment’s then-current professional services rates, which shall be made available to Customer upon request. Customer will be responsible for any fees charged by any auditor appointed by Customer to execute any such audit. Nothing in this Addendum shall be construed to require Segment to furnish more information about its Third Party Subprocessors in connection with such audits than such Third Party Subprocessors make generally available to their customers. Nothing in this Section 2.b. shall require Segment to breach any duties of confidentiality.</p></li>
  </ol>
<br />
<h3> 3. Impact Assessments and Consultations</h3>

<p>Segment may (taking into account the nature of the Processing and the information available to Segment) reasonably assist Customer in complying with Customer’s obligations under Articles 35 and 36 of the GDPR, by (a) making available documentation describing relevant aspects of Segment’s information security program and the security measures applied in connection therewith; and (b) providing the other information contained in the Agreement, including this Addendum.</p>
<br />
<h3> 4. Data Transfers</h3>
<ol id="lower-alpha">
  <li><p><strong>Data Processing Facilities</strong>. Segment may, subject to Section 4.b., store and Process Customer Personal Data in the United States or anywhere Segment or its Subprocessors maintain facilities. Subject to Segment’s obligations in this Section 4, Customer is responsible for ensuring that its use of the Services complies with any cross-border data transfer restrictions of EU Data Protection Law.</p></li>
  <li><p><strong>Privacy Shield</strong>. To the extent that Segment Processes any Customer Personal Data of individuals in the EU or Switzerland in the United States, then Segment shall protect such Customer Personal Data in accordance with the Privacy Shield Principles and Supplemental Principles of the EU-U.S. and Swiss Privacy Shield Frameworks (“<strong>Privacy Shield</strong>”). If Segment is unable to comply with this requirement, Segment shall inform Customer.</p></li>
  <li><p><strong>Standard Contractual Clauses</strong>. If Customer is established in the EU and transfers Customer Personal Data out of the EU to Segment in a country not deemed by the European Commission to have adequate data protection, and the Privacy Shield ceases to be a basis by which Customer may lawfully make such transfer to Segment under Chapter V of the GDPR, and no lawful alternative basis for such transfer applies, such transfer will be governed by the Standard Contractual Clauses, the terms of which are hereby incorporated into this DPA. In furtherance of the foregoing, the parties agree that:</p></li>
  <ol id="lower-roman">
    <li><p>for purposes of the Standard Contractual Clauses, (a) Customer will act as the data exporter and (b) Segment will act as the data importer;</p></li>
    <li><p>for purposes of Appendix 1 to the Standard Contractual Clauses, the Data Subjects, categories of data, and the processing operations shall be as set out in Section 1.b. to this <a href="#annex-a--eu-annex">Annex A</a>;</p></li>

    <li><p>upon data exporter’s request under the Standard Contractual Clauses, data importer will provide the copies of the Subprocessor agreements that must be sent by the data importer to the data exporter pursuant to Clause 5(j) of the Standard Contractual Clauses, and data importer may remove or redact all commercial information or clauses unrelated to the Standard Contractual Clauses or their equivalent beforehand;</p></li>
    <li><p>the audits described in Clause 5(f) and Clause 12(2) of the Standard Contractual Clauses shall be performed in accordance with Section 2.b. of this <a href="#annex-a--eu-annex">Annex A</a>;</p></li>
    <li><p>Customer’s authorizations in Section 6 of this Addendum (Subprocessing) will constitute Customer’s prior written consent to the subcontracting by Segment of the Processing of Customer Personal Data if such consent is required under Clause 5(h) of the Standard Contractual Clauses;</p></li>
    <li><p>certification of deletion of Customer Personal Data as described in Clause 12(1) of the Standard Contractual Clauses shall be provided only upon Customer’s request; and</p></li>
    <li><p>the Standard Contractual Clauses shall automatically terminate once the Customer Personal Data transfer governed thereby becomes lawful under Chapter V of the GDPR in the absence of such Standard Contractual Clauses on any other basis.</p></li>
