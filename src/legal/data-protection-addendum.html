<ol id="lower-alpha">

<li><p>Any liabilities arising under this Addendum are subject to the limitations of liability in the Agreement.</p></li>
<li><p>This Addendum will be governed by and construed in accordance with governing law and jurisdiction provisions in the Agreement, unless required otherwise by applicable Data Protection Laws.</p></li>
<li><p>This Addendum will automatically terminate upon expiration or termination of the Agreement.</p></li>
</ol>

<h3> 4. Scope of this Addendum</h3>

<p>This Addendum applies to Segment’s Processing of Customer Personal Data under the Agreement, except that <span class="underline">Annex A</span> (EU Annex) to this Addendum applies only to such Processing of Customer Personal Data governed by EU Data Protection Law and <span class="underline">Annex B</span> (California Annex) to this Addendum applies only to such Processing of Customer Personal Data governed by the CCPA.</p></li>

<h3> 5. Role and Scope of the Processing</h3>

<ol id="lower-alpha">
<li><p>Segment will Process Customer Data only in accordance with Customer’s instructions. By entering into the Agreement, Customer instructs Segment to Process Customer Data to provide the Services and pursuant to any other written instructions given by Customer and acknowledged in writing by Segment as constituting instructions for purposes of this Addendum. Customer acknowledges and agrees that such instruction authorizes Segment to Process Customer Data (a) to perform its obligations and exercise its rights under the Agreement; and (b) to perform its legal obligations and to establish, exercise or defend legal claims in respect of the Agreement.</p></li>
<li><p>For clarity, nothing in this Addendum limits Segment from transmitting Customer Data to and among Sources and Destinations as directed by Customer through the Services. The parties agree that neither Sources nor Destinations are Subprocessors of Segment and that, between the parties, Customer is solely responsible for the Processing of Customer Personal Data by, and other acts and omissions of, Sources and Destinations or parties associated therewith.</p></li>
</ol>

<h3> 6. Subprocessing</h3>
<ol id="lower-alpha">
<li><p>Customer specifically authorizes Segment to use its Affiliates as Subprocessors, and generally authorizes Segment to engage Third Party Subprocessors to Process Customer Personal Data. Segment:</p></li>
  <ol id="lower-roman">
  <li><p>shall enter into a written agreement with each Subprocessor, imposing data protection obligations substantially similar to those set out in this Addendum; and</p></li>
  <li><p>remains liable for compliance with the obligations of this Addendum and for any acts or omissions of the Subprocessor that cause Segment to breach any of its obligations under this Addendum.</p></li>
  </ol>
<li><p>A list of Segment’s Subprocessors, including their functions and locations, is available at <a href="https://segment.com/docs/legal/subprocessors/">https://segment.com/docs/legal/subprocessors/</a> or such other website as Segment may designate (“<strong>"Subprocessor Page</strong>"”), and may be updated by Segment from time to time in accordance with this Addendum.</p></li>
<li><p>When any new Third Party Subprocessor is engaged, Segment will notify Customer of the engagement, which notice may be given by updating the Subprocessor Page and via a message through Customer’s Segment Workspace. Segment will give such notice at least ten (10) calendar days before the new Subprocessor Processes any Customer Personal Data, except that if Segment reasonably believes engaging a new Subprocessor on an expedited basis is necessary to protect the confidentiality, integrity or availability of the Customer Personal Data or avoid material disruption to the Services, Segment will give such notice as soon as reasonably practicable. If, within five (5) calendar days after such notice, Customer notifies Segment in writing that Customer objects to Segment’s appointment of a new Third Party Subprocessor based on reasonable data protection concerns, the parties will discuss such concerns in good faith and whether they can be resolved. If the parties are not able to mutually agree to a resolution of such concerns, Customer, as its sole and exclusive remedy, may terminate the Agreement for convenience.</p></li>
</ol>

<h3> 7. Security</h3>

<ol id="lower-alpha">
<li><p>Segment shall implement and maintain technical and organizational security measures designed to protect Customer Personal Data from Security Incidents and to preserve the security and confidentiality of the Customer Personal Data, in accordance with Segment’s security standards referenced in the Agreement ("<strong>Security Measures</strong>").</p></li>
<li><p>Customer is responsible for reviewing the information made available by Segment relating to data security and making an independent determination as to whether the Services meet Customer’s requirements and legal obligations under Data Protection Laws. Customer acknowledges that the Security Measures may be updated from time to time upon reasonable notice to Customer to reflect process improvements or changing practices (but the modifications will not materially decrease Segment’s obligations as compared to those reflected in such terms as of the Effective Date).</p></li>
<li><p>Upon becoming aware of a confirmed Security Incident, Segment shall notify Customer without undue delay unless prohibited by applicable law. A delay in giving such notice requested by law enforcement and/or in light of Segment’s legitimate needs to investigate or remediate the matter before providing notice shall not constitute an undue delay. Such notices will describe, to the extent possible, details of the Security Incident, including steps taken to mitigate the potential risks and steps Segment recommends Customer take to address the Security Incident. Without prejudice to Segment’s obligations under this Section 7.c., Customer is solely responsible for complying with Security Incident notification laws applicable to Customer and fulfilling any third party notification obligations related to any Security Incidents. Segment’s notification of or response to a Security Incident under this Section 7.c. will not be construed as an acknowledgement by Segment of any fault or liability with respect to the Security Incident.</p></li>
<li><p>Customer agrees that, without limitation of Segment’s obligations under this Section 7, Customer is solely responsible for its use of the Services, including (a) making appropriate use of the Services to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk in respect of the Customer Data; (b) securing the account authentication credentials, systems and devices Customer uses to access the Services; (c) securing Customer’s systems and devices that it uses with the Services; and (d) maintaining its own backups of Customer Data.</p></li>
</ol>

<h3> 8. Data Subject Requests</h3>
<p>Segment shall upon Customer’s request (and at Customer’s expense) provide Customer with such assistance as it may reasonably require to comply with its obligations under Data Protection Laws to respond to requests from individuals to exercise their rights under Data Protection Laws (e.g., rights of data access, rectification, erasure, restriction, portability and objection) in cases where Customer cannot reasonably fulfill such requests independently by using the self-service functionality of the Services. If Segment receives a request from a Data Subject in relation to their Customer Personal Data, Segment will advise the Data Subject to submit their request to Customer, and Customer will be responsible for responding to any such request.</p>

<h3> 9. Return or Deletion of Data</h3>
<ol id="lower-alpha">
<li><p>Segment shall, within sixty (60) days after request by Customer following the termination or expiration of the Agreement, delete all of the Customer Personal Data from Segment’s systems.</p></li>
<li><p>Notwithstanding the foregoing, Customer understands that Segment may retain Customer Personal Data if required by law, which data will remain subject to the requirements of this Addendum.</p></li>
</ol>
<br />

<h2> Annex A – EU Annex</h2>

<h3> 1. Definitions; Processing of Data</h3>

<ol id="lower-alpha">
  <li><p><strong>Definitions</strong>. For purposes of this <span class="underline">Annex A</span>, the terms “<strong>controller</strong>”, “<strong>processor</strong>” and “<strong>supervisory authority</strong>” have the meanings given in EU Data Protection Law; “<strong>Standard Contractual Clauses</strong>” means the Standard Contractual Clauses for Processors as approved by the European Commission under Decision 2010/87/EU in the form made accessible in Customer’s Segment Workspace; and “<strong>data importer</strong>” and “<strong>data exporter</strong>” have the meanings given in the Standard Contractual Clauses.</p></li>
  <li><p><strong>Subject Matter and Details of Processing</strong>. The parties acknowledge and agree that (a) the subject matter of the Processing under the Agreement is Segment’s provision of the Services; (b) the duration of the Processing is from Segment’s receipt of Customer Personal Data until deletion of all Customer Personal Data by Segment in accordance with the Agreement; (c) the nature and purpose of the Processing is to provide the Services; (d) the Data Subjects to whom the Processing pertains are Customer’s customers, end users or other individuals to whom Customer Personal Data pertains; and (e) the categories of Customer Personal Data are such categories as Customer is authorized to ingest into the Services under the Agreement.</p></li>
  <li><p><strong>Roles and Regulatory Compliance; Authorization</strong>. The parties acknowledge and agree that (a) Segment is a processor of the Customer Personal Data under EU Data Protection Law; (b) Customer is a controller of the Customer Personal Data under EU Data Protection Law; and (c) each party will comply with the obligations applicable to it in such role under EU Data Protection Law with respect to the Processing of Customer Personal Data. To the extent that any Usage Data (as defined in the Agreement) is considered Personal Data, Segment is the controller with respect to such data and shall Process such data in accordance with its Privacy Policy, which can be found at segment.com/docs/legal/privacy.</p></li>
  <li><p><strong>Segment’s Compliance with Instructions</strong>. Segment will only Process Customer Personal Data in accordance with Customer’s instructions in this Addendum unless EU Data Protection Law requires otherwise, in which case Segment will notify Customer (unless that law prohibits Segment from doing so).</p></li>
</ol>

<h3> 2. Data Security</h3>

<ol id="lower-alpha">
  <li><p><strong>Segment Security Measures, Controls and Assistance</strong></p></li>
  <ol id="lower-roman">
    <li><p>Segment will (taking into account the nature of the Processing of Customer Personal Data and the information available to Segment) provide Customer with reasonable assistance necessary for Customer to comply with its obligations in respect of Customer Personal Data under EU Data Protection Law, including Articles 32 to 34 (inclusive) of the GDPR, by (a) implementing and maintaining the Security Measures; (b) complying with the terms of Section 7 of this Addendum; and (c) complying with this <span class="underline">Annex A</span>.</p></li>
    <li><p>Segment will grant access to Customer Personal Data only to personnel who need such access for the scope of their job duties, and are subject to appropriate confidentiality obligations. Should an employee of a Customer seek to exercise their rights under EU Data Protection Laws (e.g., rights of data access, rectification, erasure, restriction, portability and objection) in respect of any Usage Data that constitutes Personal Data then the Customer undertakes to inform Segment without delay and instruct their employee to contact Segment directly via <a href="mailto:privacy@segment.com">privacy@segment.com</a> or such other email address as directed at the time.</p></li>
  </ol>
  <li><p><strong>Audits and Reviews of Compliance</strong>. To the extent applicable Data Protection Laws include a right for Customer to audit Segment’s Processing of Customer Personal Data, Customer will exercise such audit right, and Segment will fulfill its corresponding obligations, as follows:</p></li>
  <ol id="lower-roman">
    <li><p>Segment shall make available to Customer relevant information regarding Segment’s Processing of Customer Personal Data under this Addendum in the form of Segment’s most recent ISO 27001, ISO 27017 or ISO 27018 certifications or similar audit reports (“<strong>Third Party Reports</strong>”).</p></li>
    <li><p>Not more than once per calendar year and at Customer’s expense, Customer may audit Segment’s Processing of Customer Personal Data for compliance with its obligations under this Addendum by submitting reasonable requests for information, including security and audit questionnaires. Segment will provide written responses to the extent the requested information is necessary to confirm Segment’s compliance with this Addendum. However, if the requested information is addressed in a Third Party Report issued within the 12-month period prior to Customer’s request and Segment confirms there have been no material changes in the interim relevant to Customer’s request, Customer agrees to accept such Third Party Report in lieu of a written response. Any information provided by Segment under this Section 2.b. constitutes Segment’s Confidential Information under the Agreement.</p></li>
    <li><p>If a third party is to conduct an audit under this Section 2.b., Segment may object to the auditor if the auditor is, in Segment’s reasonable opinion, not independent, a competitor of Segment or otherwise unqualified. Such objection by Segment will require Customer to appoint another auditor or conduct the audit itself.</p></li>
    <li><p>Customer will promptly notify Segment of any non-compliance discovered during the course of an audit and provide Segment any audit reports generated in connection with any audit under this Section 2.b., unless prohibited by EU Data Protection Law or otherwise instructed by a supervisory authority. Customer may use the audit reports only for the purposes of meeting Customer’s regulatory audit requirements and confirming that Segment’s Processing of Customer Personal Data complies with this Addendum.</p></li>
    <li><p>Customer shall reimburse Segment for any time expended by Segment or its Subprocessors in connection with any audits under this Section 2.b. at Segment’s then-current professional services rates, which shall be made available to Customer upon request. Customer will be responsible for any fees charged by any auditor appointed by Customer to execute any such audit. Nothing in this Addendum shall be construed to require Segment to furnish more information about its Third Party Subprocessors in connection with such audits than such Third Party Subprocessors make generally available to their customers. Nothing in this Section 2.b. shall require Segment to breach any duties of confidentiality.</p></li>
  </ol>
<br />
<h3> 3. Impact Assessments and Consultations</h3>

<p>Segment may (taking into account the nature of the Processing and the information available to Segment) reasonably assist Customer in complying with Customer’s obligations under Articles 35 and 36 of the GDPR, by (a) making available documentation describing relevant aspects of Segment’s information security program and the security measures applied in connection therewith; and (b) providing the other information contained in the Agreement, including this Addendum.</p>
<br />
<h3> 4. Data Transfers</h3>
<ol id="lower-alpha">
  <li><p><strong>Data Processing Facilities</strong>. Segment may, subject to Section 4.b., store and Process Customer Personal Data in the United States or anywhere Segment or its Subprocessors maintain facilities. Subject to Segment’s obligations in this Section 4, Customer is responsible for ensuring that its use of the Services complies with any cross-border data transfer restrictions of EU Data Protection Law.</p></li>
  <li><p><strong>Privacy Shield</strong>. To the extent that Segment Processes any Customer Personal Data of individuals in the EU or Switzerland in the United States, then Segment shall protect such Customer Personal Data in accordance with the Privacy Shield Principles and Supplemental Principles of the EU-U.S. and Swiss Privacy Shield Frameworks (“<strong>Privacy Shield</strong>”). If Segment is unable to comply with this requirement, Segment shall inform Customer.</p></li>
  <li><p><strong>Standard Contractual Clauses</strong>. If Customer is established in the EU and transfers Customer Personal Data out of the EU to Segment in a country not deemed by the European Commission to have adequate data protection, and the Privacy Shield ceases to be a basis by which Customer may lawfully make such transfer to Segment under Chapter V of the GDPR, and no lawful alternative basis for such transfer applies, such transfer will be governed by the Standard Contractual Clauses, the terms of which are hereby incorporated into this DPA. In furtherance of the foregoing, the parties agree that:</p></li>
  <ol id="lower-roman">
    <li><p>for purposes of the Standard Contractual Clauses, (a) Customer will act as the data exporter and (b) Segment will act as the data importer;</p></li>
    <li><p>for purposes of Appendix 1 to the Standard Contractual Clauses, the Data Subjects, categories of data, and the processing operations shall be as set out in Section 1.b. to this <span class="underline">Annex A</span>;</p></li>
    <li><p>for purposes of Appendix 2 to the Standard Contractual Clauses, the technical and organizational measures shall be the Security Measures;</p></li>
    <li><p>upon data exporter’s request under the Standard Contractual Clauses, data importer will provide the copies of the Subprocessor agreements that must be sent by the data importer to the data exporter pursuant to Clause 5(j) of the Standard Contractual Clauses, and data importer may remove or redact all commercial information or clauses unrelated to the Standard Contractual Clauses or their equivalent beforehand;</p></li>
    <li><p>the audits described in Clause 5(f) and Clause 12(2) of the Standard Contractual Clauses shall be performed in accordance with Section 2.b. of this <span class="underline">Annex A</span>;</p></li>
    <li><p>Customer’s authorizations in Section 6 of this Addendum (Subprocessing) will constitute Customer’s prior written consent to the subcontracting by Segment of the Processing of Customer Personal Data if such consent is required under Clause 5(h) of the Standard Contractual Clauses;</p></li>
    <li><p>certification of deletion of Customer Personal Data as described in Clause 12(1) of the Standard Contractual Clauses shall be provided only upon Customer’s request; and</p></li>
    <li><p>the Standard Contractual Clauses shall automatically terminate once the Customer Personal Data transfer governed thereby becomes lawful under Chapter V of the GDPR in the absence of such Standard Contractual Clauses on any other basis.</p></li>
  </ol>
  </ol>
<br />
<h2> Annex B - California Annex</h2>
<ol id="lower-alpha">

<li><p>The parties acknowledge and agree that the Processing of Customer Personal Data authorized by Customer’s instructions described in Section 5 of this Addendum is integral to and encompassed by Segment’s provision of the Services and the direct business relationship between the parties.</p></li>
<li><p>Notwithstanding anything in the Agreement or any Order Form entered in connection therewith, the parties acknowledge and agree that Segment’s access to Customer Personal Data does not constitute part of the consideration exchanged by the parties in respect of the Agreement.</p></li>
<li><p>To the extent that any Usage Data (as defined in the Agreement) is considered Personal Data, Segment is the business with respect to such data and shall Process such data in accordance with its <strong>Privacy Policy, which can be found at segment.com/docs/legal/privacy.</strong></p></li>
