## Segment's Service and Customer Data

Registered users of the Service ("**Customers**") are businesses that
use it to collect and manage information about their own users
("**Customer Data**"), including information about how they interact
with the Customer's websites, applications, services and designated
third-party partners ("**Customer Services**"). Customers also use the
Service to more efficiently route Customer Data to the other services
that they use or to third parties that they work with, and to control
how Customer Data is exchanged between these services and third parties.

Customer Data may include, without limitation, information about the
identity of Customer users (such as name, postal address, e-mail
address, IP address and phone number), as well as information about the
pages users visit, the features they use, and the actions they take
while using Customer Services. This Privacy Policy does not apply to
Customer Data or to Customer Services, and we are not responsible for
our Customers' handling of Customer Data. Our Customers have their own
policies regarding the collection, use and disclosure of your personal
information. To learn about how a particular Customer handles your
personal information, we encourage you to read the Customer's privacy
policy. Our use of Customer Data provided by our Customers in connection
with our Service is subject to the written agreement between Segment and
Customer.

<a id="Additional-Information-for-California-Residents"></a>

## Important Information for California Residents

This section applies only to California residents. It describes how we
collect, use and share Personal Information of California residents in
operating our business, and their rights with respect to that Personal
Information. For purposes of this section, "**Personal Information**"
has the meaning given in the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018
("**CCPA**") but does not include information exempted from the scope of
the CCPA.

### Your California privacy rights.
You have the rights listed below. However, these rights are not absolute, and in certain cases we may decline your request as permitted by law. 

-   **Information.** You can request the following information about how
    we have collected and used your Personal Information during the past
    12 months:

    -   The categories of Personal Information that we have collected.

    -   The categories of sources from which we collected Personal
        Information.

    -   The business or commercial purpose for collecting and/or selling
        Personal Information.

    -   The categories of third parties with whom we share Personal
        Information.

    -   Whether we have disclosed your Personal Information for a
        business purpose, and if so, the categories of Personal
        Information received by each category of third party recipient.

    -   Whether we've sold your Personal Information, and if so, the
        categories of Personal Information received by each category of
        third party recipient.

-   **Access**. You can request a copy of the Personal Information that
    we have collected about you during the past 12 months.

-   **Deletion.** You can ask us to delete the Personal Information that
    we have collected from you.

-   **Nondiscrimination.** You are entitled to exercise the rights
    described above free from discrimination. This means that we will
    not penalize you for exercising your rights by taking actions such
    as denying you services; increasing the price/rate of services;
    decreasing service quality; or suggesting that we may penalize you
    as described above for exercising your rights.

### How to exercise your information, access and deletion rights.
You may submit a request to exercise your information, access or deletion
rights by visiting emailing [privacy@segment.com](mailto:privacy@segment.com) or emailing us toll-free at (866) 538-5962. We will need to verify your identity to process your information, access and deletion
requests and we reserve the right to confirm your California residency.
Government identification may be required. If you wish to designate an
authorized agent to make a request on your behalf, we will need to
verify both your and your agent's identities and your agent must provide
valid power of attorney or other proof of authority acceptable to us in
our reasonable discretion. We cannot process your request if you do not
provide us with sufficient detail to allow us to understand and respond
to it. In certain cases, we may be required or permitted by law to deny
your request.

### We do not sell your personal information.
Based on our current
understanding of the CCPA, we do not "sell" your personal information as
defined in the CCPA. However, like many companies online, Segment uses
services provided by Google, Facebook and other advertising companies
that track website visitor activity to help deliver interest-based ads
to those visitors. We describe this in more detail in the section above
entitled Interest-based advertising. Use of these services may
constitute a "sale" of Personal Information under the CCPA where the
user has not opted into the tracking. We no longer permit these services
to track your use of the Site for interest-based advertising unless you
opt-in, and you can always opt-out in our [Website Data Collection
Preferences center](https://segment.com/docs/legal/website-data-collection-policy/). However, our past practice of allowing this tracking
on an opt-out basis may have resulted in the "sale" of your Personal
Information prior to January 1, 2020.

### Personal information we collect, use and disclose.
The chart below describes the categories of Personal Information we collect by reference
to the categories specified by the CCPA (California Civil Code §
1798.140(o)).

*Effective as of July 18, 2018.*

Segment.io, Inc. ("**Segment**" or "**we**", "**us**" or "**our**")
complies with the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework and the Swiss-U.S.
Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce
regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal data
transferred to it in the United States from the European Economic Area
("EEA") or Switzerland, respectively. We have certified to the
Department of Commerce that we adhere to the Privacy Shield Principles.
To learn more about the Privacy Shield program, the Privacy Shield
Principles and to view our certification, please
visit [www.privacyshield.gov](https://www.privacyshield.gov/).

**Scope**. Our certification of adherence to the Privacy Shield
Principles applies to the personal data that (a) we collect from our
customers and other visitors to our website for account management,
billing or marketing purposes ("**Segment User Data**") and (b) that we
process on behalf of our customers in providing online services to them
under a service agreement ("**Services Data**").

**Data processed**. The Segment User Data that we collect, use and share
is described in our Privacy Policy. While our customers decide what
Services Data to submit, it typically includes information about their
own users and how they use the customer's sites, applications and
services and third party applications. We process Services Data as
instructed by our customers and do not own or control Services Data.

Purposes of data processing. We collect, use and share Segment User Data
for the purposes described in our Privacy Policy. We process Services
Data for the purpose of providing our online services to our customers,
which may include accessing and processing the data to provide the
services, to correct and address technical or service problems, to
follow instructions of the customer who submitted the data, or in
response to contractual requirements.

### Inquiries and complaints. 
If you believe Segment maintains your
personal data within the scope of our Privacy Shield certification, you
may direct any inquiries or complaints concerning our Privacy Shield
compliance to [privacy@segment.com](mailto:privacy@segment.com). If you are located in the EEA or Switzerland and have an unresolved privacy or data use concern that we
have not addressed satisfactorily, please contact our U.S.-based third
party dispute resolution provider (free of charge)
at <https://feedback-form.truste.com/watchdog/request>.

### Arbitration. 
If you are located in the EEA or Switzerland and

complaint, you may be entitled to invoke binding arbitration under
certain conditions more fully described on the [Privacy Shield
website](https://www.privacyshield.gov/article?id=How-to-Submit-a-Complaint).

### Third parties who may receive personal data. 
We share Segment User Data with third parties as described in our Privacy Policy. We may share
Services Data with third parties under the following circumstances and
only in accordance with the applicable customer agreements:

-   **Affiliates.** We may disclose Services Data to our subsidiaries
    and corporate affiliates for use consistent with this Privacy
    Policy.

-   **Service Providers.** We may employ third party companies and
    individuals to administer and provide the Service on our behalf
    (such as customer support, hosting, website analytics, email
    delivery, database management services). Segment maintains contracts
    with these service providers restricting their access, use and
    disclosure of personal data in compliance with our Privacy Shield
    obligations, including the onward transfer provisions, and we may be
    liable if they fail to meet those obligations and we are responsible
    for the event giving rise to damage.

-   **Legal requirements.** We may disclose Services Data if required to
    do so by law in order to (for example) respond to a subpoena or
    request from law enforcement, a court or a government agency, or in
    the good faith belief that such action is necessary (a) to comply
    with a legal obligation, (b) to protect or defend our rights,
    interests or property or that of third parties, (c) to prevent or
    investigate possible wrongdoing in connection with the services, (d)
    to act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of
    customers, their users or the public; or (e) to protect against
    legal liability.

-   **Business Transfers.** As we develop our business, we might sell or
    buy businesses or assets. In the event of a corporate sale, merger,
    reorganization, dissolution or similar event, Services Data may be
    part of the transferred assets.

In addition, we may be required to disclose any personal data that we
process in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including
to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.

### Your rights to access, to limit use, and to limit disclosure.
Individuals in the EEA and Switzerland have rights to
access personal data about them, and to limit use and disclosure of
their personal data. With our Privacy Shield self-certification, we have
committed to respect those rights. We process Services Data only on
behalf of our customers in accordance with their instructions. This
means that if you wish to access Services Data and request that we
correct, amend or delete it if it is inaccurate or processed in
violation of Privacy Shield, you should contact that customer with your
request. We will then help them to fulfill that request in accordance
with their instructions.

If your personal data includes Segment Personal Data, you can request
access to that data and request that we correct amend, or delete it if
it is inaccurate or processed in violation of Privacy Shield by emailing
your request to <privacy@segment.com>. We may request specific
information from you to help us confirm your identity and process your
request. Applicable law may require or permit us to decline your
request. If we decline your request, we will tell you why, subject to
legal restrictions.

### U.S. Federal Trade Commission Enforcement.

powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission.   If there is any conflict

Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall take precedence.
