("**Segment**") and the entity or person placing an order for or accessing the Service ("**Customer**" or "**you**"). This Agreement consists of the terms and conditions set forth below and any Segment ordering documents, online registration, order descriptions or order confirmations referencing this Agreement ("**Order Forms**").

The "**Effective Date**" of this Agreement is the date which is the earlier of (a) Customer's initial access to the Service (as defined below) through any online provisioning, registration or order process or (b) the effective date of the first Order Form referencing this Agreement. This Agreement will govern Customer's initial purchase on the Effective Date as well as any future purchases made by Customer that reference this Agreement.

## **Modifications**

You acknowledge and agree that Segment may modify the terms and conditions of this Agreement at any time in accordance with Section 12 (Modifications to Agreement).

**BY INDICATING YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT OR ACCESSING OR USING THE SERVICE, YOU ARE AGREEING TO BE BOUND BY ALL TERMS, CONDITIONS, AND NOTICES CONTAINED OR REFERENCED IN THIS AGREEMENT. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THIS AGREEMENT, PLEASE DO NOT USE THE SERVICE. FOR CLARITY, EACH PARTY EXPRESSLY AGREES THAT THIS AGREEMENT IS LEGALLY BINDING UPON IT.**

## **1. SEGMENT SERVICE**

### 1.1. Overview

The Service acts as a central hub for Customer Data, allowing Customer to collect Customer Data from its selected sources ("**Sources**"), such as its own or third-party websites or properties, and send the Customer Data to Customer's chosen destinations ("**Destinations**"), such as Customer's databases or its accounts with third-party applications or services, for Customer's further use. The supported Sources and Destinations are identified in the Documentation. As further described below and in the Documentation, Customer maintains control over which Sources and Destinations it uses with the Service, as well as the types and content of Customer Data it shares between its Sources and Destinations.

### 1.2. Segment Code

For Sources owned or controlled by Customer ("**Customer Properties**"), Customer will enable the collection of Customer Data by implementing Segment's JavaScript, SDK or other code ("**Segment Code**") on the Customer Properties.

### 1.3. Definitions

"**Customer Data**" means any data that Customer submits to the Service, including data that it collects from Customer Properties or retrieves from other Sources through the Service.

"**Documentation**" means the end user technical documentation provided with the Service, as may be modified from time to time.

"**Laws**" means all applicable local, state, federal and international laws, regulations and conventions, including, without limitation, those related to data privacy and data transfer, international communications, and the exportation of technical or personal data.

"**Order Form**" is defined above.

"**Sensitive Personal Information**" means any of the following: (i) credit, debit or other payment card data subject to the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards ("**PCI DSS**"); (ii) patient, medical or other protected health information regulated by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act ("**HIPAA**"); (iii) any information deemed to be "special categories of data" of an EU resident (prior to May 25, 2018, as such term is defined in EU Data Protection Directive 95/46/EC; and on and after May 25, 2018, as defined in European Union Regulation 2016/679) or (iv) any other personal or sensitive information subject to regulation or protection under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, Children's Online Privacy Protection Act or other Laws.

"**Service**" means the specific Segment proprietary hosted service solution(s) specified on an Order Form, including the Segment dashboard and any related Segment Code and API(s).

### 1.4. Access to the Service

Customer may access and use the Service for its internal business operations, subject to this Agreement (including Section 2 (Service Plans and Beta Releases)), the Documentation, and any scope of use restrictions on the applicable Order Form.  This includes the right to implement Segment Code on Customer Properties in order to collect Customer Data for use with the Service. Access to the Service is limited to Customer's employees and contractors acting for the sole benefit of Customer ("**Permitted Users**"). Customer and its Permitted Users may need to register for a Segment account in order to access or use the Service. Account registration information must be accurate, current and complete, and will be governed by Segment's Privacy Policy (currently available at [https://segment.com/docs/legal/privacy/](https://segment.com/docs/legal/privacy/)). Customer is responsible for any use of the Service by its Permitted Users and their compliance with this Agreement.  Customer shall keep confidential its user IDs and passwords for the Service and remain responsible for any actions taken through its accounts.

### 1.5. Use Restrictions

Customer shall not (and shall not permit any third party to): (a) rent, lease, provide access to or sublicense the Service to a third party; (b) use the Service to provide, or incorporate the Service into, any product or service provided to a third party; (c) use or attempt to use the Service for competitive analysis or benchmarking; (d) reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, or otherwise seek to obtain the source code or non-public APIs to the Service, except to the extent expressly permitted by applicable law (and then only upon advance notice to Segment); (e) copy, modify or create any derivative work of the Service or any Documentation; (f) remove or obscure any proprietary or other notices contained in the Service (including any reports or data printed from the Service); or (g) publicly disseminate information regarding the performance of the Service.

### 1.6. Storage and Processing of Customer Data

Segment may store certain Customer Data submitted from Sources to enable various features and functionality of the Service, including for "replay" and re-sending of Customer Data to Destinations at Customer's direction. Customer acknowledges that Customer Data transmitted through the Service may be stored and processed by Segment in the United States or in other countries in which Segment or its subcontractors maintain facilities.

## **2. SERVICE PLANS AND BETA RELEASES**

### 2.1. Service Plans

Segment makes available the Service through a free "Developer" plan ("**Developer Plan**"), trial plans ("**Trial Plans**") and paid plans ("**Paid Plans**"). Current plans are described at [https://segment.com/pricing](https://segment.com/pricing)\*\* \*\*and Customer's specific plan will be identified in the Order Form presented when Customer registers, orders or pays for the Service. Customer's permitted scope of use – such as features available, permitted number of monthly tracked users (MTUs) and other usage limits – depends on the plan that Customer selects and will be specified on the applicable Order Form.

### 2.2. Paid Plans

Paid Plans are provided on a subscription basis for a set term designated on the Order Form (each, a "**Subscription Term**"). Unless otherwise specified on the applicable Order Form, each Subscription Term shall automatically renew for the same period as the then-current Subscription Term unless either party gives the other written notice of termination at least thirty (30) days prior to expiration of the then-current Subscription Term (e.g., monthly Paid Plans will automatically roll over month-to-month and annual Paid Plans will automatically renew for additional 12-month periods).

### 2.3. Developer Plans and Trial Plans

* (a) _Developer Plans_. If Customer receives access to the Service through a Developer Plan, then Customer may use the Service in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement for so long as Segment chooses to offer the Developer Plan.

* (b) _Trial Plans_. For Trial Plans, Customer may use the Service in accordance with this Agreement for the limited trial period designated on the Order Form or such other period as may be specified by Segment (the "**Trial Period**"). Trial Plans are permitted solely for Customer's use to determine whether to purchase a Paid Plan. If Customer does not upgrade from a Trial Plan to a Paid Plan at the end of the Trial Period, then Customer's access to the Service may be limited or suspended (to be determined at Segment's sole discretion) until such time as Customer terminates this Agreement or converts to a Paid Plan.

* (c) _Special Terms_. Developer Plans and Trial Plans may not include all features or functionality offered as part of Paid Plans, and Segment reserves the right to add or subtract any features or functionality at any time for such plans. Segment has the right to suspend or terminate a Developer Plan or Trial Plan at any time for any reason.

### 2.4. Additional Personas Terms

If Customer receives access to Segment's "Personas" service ("**Personas**"), then the additional terms and conditions at [https://segment.com/docs/legal/personas-terms/](https://segment.com/docs/legal/personas-terms/) (Segment Personas Terms) will apply to Customer's use of Personas.

### 2.5. Beta Releases

From time to time, Segment may grant Customer access to "alpha", "beta", or other early-stage products ("**Beta Releases**"). While Segment may provide assistance with Beta Releases in its discretion, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, CUSTOMER AGREES THAT ANY BETA RELEASE IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" BASIS. CUSTOMER FURTHER ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT BETA RELEASES MAY NOT BE COMPLETE OR FULLY FUNCTIONAL AND MAY CONTAIN BUGS, ERRORS, OMISSIONS, AND OTHER PROBLEMS FOR WHICH SEGMENT WILL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE. ACCORDINGLY, ANY USE OF A BETA RELEASE IS AT CUSTOMER'S SOLE RISK. Segment makes no promises that future versions of a Beta Release will be released. Segment may terminate Customer's right to use any Beta Release at any time for any reason or no reason in Segment's sole discretion, without liability.

## **3. FEES AND PAYMENT**

### 3.1. Fees and Payment

All fees for Paid Plans are as set forth in the applicable Order Form and shall be paid by Customer in accordance with the payment terms set forth in the Order Form. If no payment terms are specified in the Order Form, then the following default terms apply: (i) for monthly Paid Plans, Customer will pay all fees at the end of the month and (ii) for annual Paid Plans, Customer will pay all fees within thirty (30) days of invoice. Except as expressly set forth in Section 12 (Modifications to Agreement), all fees are non-refundable. Segment reserves the right to increase the rates specified in the Order Form upon any renewal of a Subscription Term. Customer is required to pay any sales, use, GST, value-added, withholding, or similar taxes or levies, whether domestic or foreign, other than taxes based on the income of Segment. Any late payments shall be subject to a service charge equal to 1.5% per month of the amount due or the maximum amount allowed by law, whichever is less.

### 3.2. Overages

If Customer exceeds its permitted usage in any month of a Subscription Term as specified in an Order Form, Segment reserves the right to charge overage fees in respect of such excess usage at the applicable overage rates set forth in the Order Form. Customer will pay any overage fees monthly in arrears.

## **4. CUSTOMER OBLIGATIONS**

### 4.1. Data Collection

Subject to this Agreement and as further described in the Documentation, Customer may configure the Customer Data elements to be collected from Sources and shared with different Destinations. In some instances, as referenced in the Service dashboard and Documentation, enabling a third-party Source involves implementing the third-party provider's own SDK or code on Customer Properties. As a result, in these cases, certain default data designated by that Source's provider may be sent directly to Customer's accounts with that Source, rather than passing through the Service.

### 4.2. Rights in Customer Data

Customer is solely responsible for the accuracy, content and legality of all Customer Data and agrees to comply with all applicable Laws in its use of the Service. Customer represents and warrants to Segment that Customer has all necessary rights, consents and permissions to collect, share and use Customer Data as contemplated in this Agreement (including granting Segment the rights in Section 6.1), without violation or infringement of (i) any third party intellectual property, publicity, privacy or other rights, (ii) any Laws, or (iii) any terms of service, privacy policies or other agreement governing the Customer Properties or Customer's accounts with third-party Sources or Destinations. By enabling use of the Service with any Source or Destination, Customer authorizes Segment to access Customer's accounts with such Source or Destination for the purposes described in this Agreement. Segment may also disclose that Customer is a customer of Segment and related technical Service data to providers of third-party Sources and Destinations used by Customer with the Service.

### 4.3. No Sensitive Personal Information

Customer specifically agrees not to use the Service to collect, store, process or transmit any Sensitive Personal Information. Customer acknowledges that Segment is not a Business Associate or subcontractor (as those terms are defined in HIPAA) or a payment card processor and that the Service is neither HIPAA nor PCI DSS compliant. Segment shall have no liability under this Agreement for Sensitive Personal Information, notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein.

### 4.4. Indemnification by Customer

Customer shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Segment from and against any and all claims, costs, damages, losses, liabilities and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and costs) arising out of or in connection with any claim arising from or relating to any Customer Data or breach or alleged breach by Customer of Sections 4.2 (Rights in Customer Data) or 4.3 (No Sensitive Personal Information). This indemnification obligation is subject to Customer receiving (i) prompt written notice of such claim (but in any event notice in sufficient time for Customer to respond without prejudice); (ii) the exclusive right to control and direct the investigation, defense, or settlement of such claim; and (iii) all necessary cooperation of Segment at Customer's expense.

## **5. SECURITY**

Segment agrees to use commercially reasonable technical and organizational measures designed to prevent unauthorized access, use, alteration or disclosure of the Service or Customer Data. However, Segment shall have no responsibility for errors in transmission, unauthorized third-party access or other causes beyond Segment's control.

## **6. OWNERSHIP**

### 6.1. Customer Data

As between the parties, Customer shall retain all right, title and interest (including any and all intellectual property rights) in and to the Customer Data as provided to Segment. Subject to the terms of this Agreement, Customer hereby grants to Segment a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free right to use, copy, store, transmit, modify, create derivative works of and display the Customer Data solely to the extent necessary to provide the Service to Customer.

### 6.2. Segment Technology

This is a subscription agreement for access to and use of the Service. Customer agrees that Segment or its suppliers retain all right, title and interest (including all patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret and other intellectual property rights) in and to the Service, all Documentation, and any and all related and underlying technology and documentation and any derivative works, modifications or improvements of any of the foregoing, including as may incorporate Feedback (as defined below). Except as expressly set forth in this Agreement, no rights in the Service or any Segment technology are granted to Customer.

### 6.3. Feedback

Customer, from time to time, may submit comments, questions, suggestions or other feedback relating to any Segment product or service to Segment ("**Feedback**"). Segment may freely use or exploit Feedback in connection with any of its products or services.

### 6.4. Aggregated Anonymous Data

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Customer agrees that Segment may obtain and aggregate technical and other data about Customer's use of the Service that is non-personally identifiable with respect to Customer ("**Aggregated Anonymous Data**"), and Segment may use the Aggregated Anonymous Data to analyze, improve, support and operate the Service and for distribution in general benchmarking data and industry reports. For clarity, this Section 6.4 does not give Segment the right to identify Customer as the source of any Aggregated Anonymous Data.

## **7. TERM AND TERMINATION; SUSPENSION**

### 7.1. Term

This Agreement is effective as of the Effective Date and will continue until terminated.

### 7.2. Termination for Cause

Either party may terminate this Agreement (including all related Order Forms) if the other party (a) fails to cure any material breach of this Agreement (including a failure to pay fees or comply with applicable scope of use restrictions) within thirty (30) days after written notice; (b) ceases operation without a successor; or (c) seeks protection under any bankruptcy, receivership, trust deed, creditors' arrangement, composition, or comparable proceeding, or if any such proceeding is instituted against that party (and not dismissed within sixty (60) days thereafter). For clarity, nothing in this Section 7.2 limits Segment's right to terminate or suspend any Developer Plan or Trial Plan as set forth in Section 2.3 (Developer Plans and Trial Plans).

### 7.3. Effect of Termination

Upon any expiration or termination of this Agreement, Customer shall immediately cease any and all use of and access to the Service (including any and all related Segment technology), cease distributing any Segment Code installed on Customer Properties, and delete (or, at Segment's request, return) any and all copies of the Documentation, any Segment passwords or access codes and any other Segment Confidential Information in its possession. Customer acknowledges that following termination it shall have no further access to any Customer Data in the Service, and that Segment may delete any such data as may have been stored by Segment at any time. Except where an exclusive remedy is specified, the exercise of either party of any remedy under this Agreement, including termination, will be without prejudice to any other remedies it may have under this Agreement, by law or otherwise.

### 7.4. Suspension of Service

In addition to Segment's termination and other rights under this Agreement, Segment reserves the right to suspend Customer's access to the Service (and any related services), in whole or in part, without liability to Customer and with immediate effect: (i) if Customer's account is thirty (30) days or more overdue; (ii) if Customer exceeds any scope of use restrictions set forth in the applicable Order Form; (iii) if Customer has breached its express obligations under Sections 1.5 (Use Restrictions) or 4 (Customer Obligations); or (iv) to prevent harm to the Service or other Segment customers.

### 7.5. Survival

The following Sections shall survive any expiration or termination of this Agreement: 1.5 (Use Restrictions), the disclaimers in Section 2.5 (Beta Releases), 3 (Fees and Payment), 4.4 (Indemnification by Customer), 6 (Ownership), 7 (Term and Termination; Suspension), 8 (Warranty Disclaimer), 9 (Limitation of Remedies and Damages), 10 (Confidential Information), 12 (Modifications to Agreement) and 13 (General Terms).

## **8. WARRANTY DISCLAIMER**

THE SERVICE AND ALL RELATED SERVICES ARE PROVIDED "AS IS". NEITHER SEGMENT NOR ITS SUPPLIERS MAKES ANY OTHER WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, TITLE, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NONINFRINGEMENT. SEGMENT DOES NOT WARRANT THAT CUSTOMER'S USE OF THE SERVICE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE, NOR DOES SEGMENT WARRANT THAT IT WILL REVIEW THE CUSTOMER DATA FOR ACCURACY OR THAT IT WILL PRESERVE OR MAINTAIN THE CUSTOMER DATA WITHOUT LOSS. CUSTOMER UNDERSTANDS THAT CUSTOMER DATA IS SHARED WITH DESTINATIONS AT CUSTOMER'S ELECTION AND SEGMENT TAKES NO RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY DESTINATION'S USE OR PROTECTION OF CUSTOMER DATA ONCE IT HAS BEEN SHARED. SEGMENT SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR DELAYS, INTERRUPTIONS, SERVICE FAILURES OR OTHER PROBLEMS INHERENT IN USE OF THE INTERNET AND ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATIONS OR OTHER SYSTEMS OUTSIDE THE REASONABLE CONTROL OF SEGMENT. CUSTOMER MAY HAVE OTHER STATUTORY RIGHTS, BUT THE DURATION OF STATUTORILY REQUIRED WARRANTIES, IF ANY, SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE SHORTEST PERIOD PERMITTED BY LAW.

## **9. LIMITATION OF REMEDIES AND DAMAGES**

### 9.1. Consequential Damages Waiver

EXCEPT FOR EXCLUDED CLAIMS (DEFINED BELOW), NEITHER PARTY (NOR ITS SUPPLIERS) SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT FOR ANY LOSS OF USE, LOST DATA, LOST PROFITS, FAILURE OF SECURITY MECHANISMS, INTERRUPTION OF BUSINESS, OR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, RELIANCE, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND, EVEN IF INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES IN ADVANCE.

### 9.2. Liability Cap

SEGMENT'S (AND ITS SUPPLIERS') ENTIRE LIABILITY TO CUSTOMER ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT SHALL NOT EXCEED THE AMOUNT ACTUALLY PAID OR PAYABLE BY CUSTOMER TO SEGMENT DURING THE PRIOR TWELVE (12) MONTHS UNDER THIS AGREEMENT.

### 9.3. Excluded Claims

"**Excluded Claims**" means (a) any claim arising from Customer's breach of Section 1.5 (Use Restrictions); or (b) any claim arising under Section 4 (Customer Obligations).

### 9.4. Nature of Claims and Failure of Essential Purpose

The parties agree that the waivers and limitations specified in this Section 9 apply regardless of the form of action, whether in contact, tort (including negligence), strict liability or otherwise and will survive and apply even if any limited remedy specified in this Agreement is found to have failed of its essential purpose.

## **10. CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION**

Each party (as "**Receiving Party**") agrees that all code, inventions, know-how, business, technical and financial information it obtains from the disclosing party ("**Disclosing Party**") constitute the confidential property of the Disclosing Party ("**Confidential Information**"), provided that it is identified as confidential at the time of disclosure or should be reasonably known by the Receiving Party to be confidential or proprietary due to the nature of the information disclosed and the circumstances surrounding the disclosure. Any Segment technology, performance information relating to the Service, and the terms and conditions of this Agreement shall be deemed Confidential Information of Segment without any marking or further designation. Except as expressly authorized herein, the Receiving Party shall (1) hold in confidence and not disclose any Confidential Information to third parties and (2) not use Confidential Information for any purpose other than fulfilling its obligations and exercising its rights under this Agreement. The Receiving Party may disclose Confidential Information to its employees, agents, contractors and other representatives having a legitimate need to know (including, for Segment, the subcontractors referenced in Section 13.10), provided that such representatives are bound to confidentiality obligations no less protective of the Disclosing Party than this Section 10 and that the Receiving Party remains responsible for compliance by any such representative with the terms of this Section 10. The Receiving Party's confidentiality obligations shall not apply to information that the Receiving Party can document: (i) was rightfully in its possession or known to it prior to receipt of the Confidential Information; (ii) is or has become public knowledge through no fault of the Receiving Party; (iii) is rightfully obtained by the Receiving Party from a third party without breach of any confidentiality obligation; or (iv) is independently developed by employees of the Receiving Party who had no access to such information. The Receiving Party may make disclosures to the extent required by law or court order, provided the Receiving Party notifies the Disclosing Party in advance and cooperates in any effort to obtain confidential treatment. The Receiving Party acknowledges that disclosure of Confidential Information would cause substantial harm for which damages alone would not be a sufficient remedy, and therefore that upon any such disclosure by the Receiving Party the Disclosing Party shall be entitled to seek appropriate equitable relief in addition to whatever other remedies it might have at law.

## **11. CO-MARKETING**

Customer agrees to participate in reasonable marketing activities that promote the benefits of the Service to other potential customers and to use of Customer's name and logo on Segment's web site and in Segment promotional materials.\*\* \*\*Customer agrees that Segment may disclose Customer as a customer of Segment.

## **12. MODIFICATIONS TO AGREEMENT**

Segment may modify the terms and conditions of this Agreement (including Service pricing and plans) from time to time, with notice given to Customer by email or through the Service. If Customer has a Developer Plan or a Trial Plan, then any modifications will become effective immediately, and if Customer disagrees with the modifications, Customer's exclusive remedy is to terminate this Agreement and cease using the Service. If Customer has a Paid Plan, Customer must notify Segment within thirty (30) days of notice of the modifications that Customer does not agree to such changes, and Segment (at its option and as Customer's exclusive remedy) may either: (a) permit Customer to continue under the prior version of this Agreement until expiration of the then-current Subscription Term (after which time the modified Agreement will apply) or (b) allow Customer to terminate this Agreement and receive a pro-rated refund of any fees Customer has pre-paid for use of the Service for the terminated portion of the applicable Subscription Term. Upon any changes to this Agreement, Customer may be required to click to agree to the modified Agreement in order to continue using the Service, and in any event continued use of the Service after the modifications take effect constitutes Customer's acceptance of the modifications.

## **13. GENERAL TERMS**

### 13.1. Assignment

This Agreement will bind and inure to the benefit of each party's permitted successors and assigns. Neither party may assign this Agreement without the advance written consent of the other party, except that Segment may assign this Agreement in connection with a merger, reorganization, acquisition or other transfer of all or substantially all of Segment's assets or voting securities. Any attempt to transfer or assign this Agreement except as expressly authorized under this Section 13.1 will be null and void.

### 13.2. Severability

If any provision of this Agreement shall be adjudged by any court of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision shall be limited to the minimum extent necessary so that this Agreement shall otherwise remain in effect.

No provision of any purchase order or other business form employed by Customer will supersede the terms and conditions of this Agreement, and any such document relating to this Agreement shall be for administrative purposes only and shall have no legal effect.

### 13.8. Entire Agreement

This Agreement is the complete and exclusive statement of the mutual understanding of the parties and supersedes and cancels all previous written and oral agreements and communications relating to the subject matter of this Agreement. Customer acknowledges that the Service is an on-line, subscription-based product, and that in order to provide improved customer experience Segment may make changes to the Service, and Segment will update the applicable Documentation accordingly.

### 13.9. Force Majeure

Neither party shall be liable to the other for any delay or failure to perform any obligation under this Agreement (except for a failure to pay fees) if the delay or failure is due to unforeseen events that occur after the signing of this Agreement and that are beyond the reasonable control of such party, such as a strike, blockade, war, act of terrorism, riot, natural disaster, failure or diminishment of power or telecommunications or data networks or services, or refusal of a license by a government agency.

### 13.10. Subcontractors

Segment may use the services of subcontractors and permit them to exercise the rights granted to Segment in order to provide the Service under this Agreement. These subcontractors may include, for example, Segment's hosting, infrastructure and CDN providers. Segment remains responsible for compliance of any such subcontractor with the terms of this Agreement and the overall performance of the Service as required under this Agreement.

### 13.11. Subpoenas

Nothing in this Agreement prevents Segment from disclosing Customer Data to the extent required by law, subpoenas, or court orders, but Segment shall use commercially reasonable efforts to notify Customer where permitted to do so.

### 13.12. Independent Contractors
