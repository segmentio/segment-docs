Reverse ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) extracts data from a data warehouse using a query you provide and syncs the data to your third party destinations. 

Use Reverse ETL when you want to:
* **Enable your marketing teams**: Sync audiences and other data built in the warehouse to Braze, Hubspot, or Salesforce Marketing Cloud for personalized marketing campaigns.
* **Enrich your customer profiles**: Sync enriched data to Mixpanel for a more complete view of the customer, or enrich Segment Unify with data from your warehouse.
* **Activate data in Twilio Engage**: Send data in the warehouse back into Segment as events that can be activated in all supported destinations, including Twilio Engage destinations.
* **Strengthen your conversion events**: Pass offline or enriched data to conversion APIs like Facebook, Google Ads, TikTok, or Snapchat.
* **Empower business teams**: Connect Google Sheets to a view in the warehouse to create up-to-date reports for other business teams.
