Reverse ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) extracts data from a warehouse using a query you provide and syncs this warehouse data to your third party destinations. 

Use Reverse ETL when you want to:
* **Elevate marketing campaigns**: Sync audiences and other data built in the warehouse to multi-channel marketing tools, like Braze, Hubspot, or Salesforce Marketing Cloud, to personalize marketing campaigns.
* **Enrich your customer profiles**: Sync enriched data to destinations like Mixpanel for a more complete view of the customer, or enrich Segment Profiles with data from your warehouse.
* **Activate data in Twilio Engage**: Send data in the warehouse back into Segment as events that can be activated in all supported destinations, including Twilio Engage destinations.
* **Strengthen your conversion events**: Pass offline or enriched data to conversion APIs like Facebook, Google Ads, TikTok, or Snapchat.
* **Make warehouse data accessible to business teams**: Connect destinations like Google Sheets to a view in the warehouse to allow business teams to access up-to-date reports.
