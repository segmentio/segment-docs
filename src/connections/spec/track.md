The Track API call is how you record any actions your users perform, along with any properties that describe the action.

{% include components/reference-button.html href="https://university.segment.com/introduction-to-segment/299975?reg=1&referrer=docs" icon="media/academy.svg" title="Segment University: The Track Method" description="Check out our high-level overview of the Track method in Segment University. (Must be logged in to access.)" %}

Each action is known as an event. Each event has a name, like **User Registered**, and properties. For example, a **User Registered** event might have properties like `plan` or `accountType`. Calling Track in one of our [sources](/docs/connections/sources/) is one of the first steps to getting started with Segment.

Here's the payload of a typical Track call with most [common fields](/docs/connections/spec/common/) removed:

```json
{
  "type": "track",
  "event": "User Registered",
  "properties": {
    "plan": "Pro Annual",
    "accountType" : "Facebook"
  }
}
```

And here's the corresponding JavaScript event that would generate the above payload:

```js
analytics.track("User Registered", {
  plan: "Pro Annual",
  accountType: "Facebook"
});
```
{% include content/syntax-note.md %}

Beyond the common fields, the Track call has the following fields:

<table>
  {% include content/spec-table-header.md %}
  {% include content/spec-field-event.md %}
  {% include content/spec-field-event-properties.md %}
</table>

## Example

Here's a complete example of a Track call:

```json
{
  "anonymousId": "23adfd82-aa0f-45a7-a756-24f2a7a4c895",
  "context": {
    "library": {

### Create your own Track call

Use the following interactive code pen to see what your Track calls look like with user-provided information:

{% include components/codepens/track-spec.html %}

## Identities

{% include content/spec-identities.md %}

## Event

Every Track call records a single user action. Segment calls these "events", and recommend that you make your event names human-readable, so that everyone on your team (even you, after all that caffeine) can know what they mean instantly.

Don't use nondescript names like **Event 12** or **TMDropd**. Instead, use unique but recognizable names like **Video Recorded** and **Order Completed**.

**Segment recommends event names built from a noun and past-tense verb.**
For more information about best practices in event naming, check out Segment's [Analytics Academy lesson on best practices for naming conventions for clean data](https://segment.com/academy/collecting-data/naming-conventions-for-clean-data/){:target="_blank"}.

Segment has standardized a series of reserved event names that have special semantic meaning. We map these events to tools that support them whenever possible. See the [Semantic Events docs](/docs/connections/spec/semantic/) for more detail.

## Properties

Properties are extra pieces of information you can tie to events you track. They can be anything that will be useful while analyzing the events later. Segment recommends sending properties whenever possible because they give you a more complete picture of what your users are doing.

Segment has reserved some properties that have semantic meanings, and handle them in special ways. For example, we always expect `revenue` to be a dollar amount that we send to tools that handle revenue tracking.

You should **only use reserved properties for their intended meaning**.

The following are all of the reserved properties Segment has standardized that apply to all events. Check out the [Semantic Events docs](/docs/connections/spec/semantic/) for properties specific to individual reserved events.

| **Property** | **Type** | **Description**     |
|--------------|----------|---------------------|
| `revenue`    | Number   | Amount of revenue an event resulted in. This should be a decimal value, so a shirt worth $19.99 would result in a `revenue` of `19.99`.    |
| `currency`   | String   | Currency of the revenue an event resulted in. This should be sent in the [ISO 4127 format](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217){:target="_blank"}. If this isn't set, Segment assumes the revenue to be in US dollars. |
| `value`      | Number   | An abstract "value" to associate with an event. This is typically used in situations where the event doesn't generate real-dollar revenue, but has an intrinsic value to a marketing team, like newsletter signups.       |

**Note:** You might be used to some destinations recognizing special properties differently. For example, Mixpanel has a special `track_charges` method for accepting revenue. Luckily, you don't have to worry about those inconsistencies. Just pass along `revenue`.  **Segment will handle all of the destination-specific conversions for you automatically.** Same goes for the rest of the reserved properties.

## Sending Traits in a Track Call - Destination Actions
All events have the ability to include additional event data in the `context` object. There may be instances when your team may want to include user traits or group traits in a Track event, such as having a single event trigger multiple events in an Actions destination. Since user Traits are not standard fields for a Track event, in order to do this, you'll need to explicitely pass the user's traits into the event payload's `context.traits` object.
_For instructions on how to pass fields to the context object for a specific library, please see the related library's Source documentation._

Segment's Actions destinations allows your team to build individual actions that are triggered based on a set of configured conditions. By adding the user's latest traits to the Track event's `context.traits` object, its possible to build two separate Actions to be triggered by this single event. For example, if your team would like to send an Identify event anytime the specific Track event "Button Clicked" is triggered, simply add the available traits into the Track event's payload, then build a destination Actions for the Track event : `Event Name is Button Clicked`, and a destination Action for the Identify event : `All of the following conditions are true: Event Name is Button Clicked, Event Context traits exists`, and then both Actions will have access to reference the `context.traits` fields within its mappings.

For more information on the context object, please see the [Spec: Common Fields](https://segment.com/docs/connections/spec/common/#context) documentation.

<table>
  {% include content/spec-table-header.md %}
  {% include content/spec-field-context.md %}
</table>

If the [Example Payload](https://segment.com/docs/connections/spec/track/#example) shared above is modified as the event `Button Clicked` with `"username": "testing-123"` in the `context.traits` object, then the event's payload would be :
```
{
  "anonymousId": "23adfd82-aa0f-45a7-a756-24f2a7a4c895",
  "context": {
    "library": {
      "name": "analytics.js",
      "version": "2.11.1"
    },
    "page": {
      "path": "/academy/",
      "referrer": "",
      "search": "",
      "title": "Analytics Academy",
      "url": "https://segment.com/academy/"
    },
    "userAgent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_11_0) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/46.0.2490.86 Safari/537.36",
    "ip": "108.0.78.21",
    "traits": {
      "username": "testing-123"
    }
  },
  "event": "Button Clicked",
  "integrations": {},
  "messageId": "ajs-f8ca1e4de5024d9430b3928bd8ac6b96",
  "properties": {

  },
  "receivedAt": "2015-12-12T19:11:01.266Z",
  "sentAt": "2015-12-12T19:11:01.169Z",
  "timestamp": "2015-12-12T19:11:01.249Z",
  "type": "track",
  "userId": "AiUGstSDIg",
  "originalTimestamp": "2015-12-12T19:11:01.152Z"
}
```

Here's what that Identify Action would look like :

## Context

Context is a dictionary of extra information that provides useful context about a datapoint, for example the user's `ip` address or `locale`. You should **only use** Context fields for their intended meaning.

| Field       | Type    | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

| `network`   | Object  | Dictionary of information about the current network connection, containing `bluetooth`, `carrier`, `cellular`, and `wifi`. If the `context.network.cellular` and `context.network.wifi` fields are empty, then the user is offline.                                                                             |

| `page`      | Object  | Dictionary of information about the current page in the browser, containing `path`, `referrer`, `search`, `title` and `url`. This is automatically collected by [Analytics.js](/docs/connections/sources/catalog/libraries/website/javascript/#context--traits).                                                |
| `referrer`  | Object  | Dictionary of information about the way the user was referred to the website or app, containing `type`, `name`, `url`, and `link`.                                                                                                                                                                              |

| `timezone`  | String  | Timezones are sent as tzdata strings to add user timezone information which might be stripped from the timestamp, for example `America/New_York`.                                                                                                                                                               |
| `groupId`   | String  | Group / Account ID. <br><br> This is useful in B2B use cases where you need to attribute your non-group calls to a company or account. It is relied on by several Customer Success and CRM tools.                                                                                                               |
| `traits`    | Object  | Dictionary of `traits` of the current user. <br><br> This is useful in cases where you need to `track` an event, but also associate information from a previous Identify call. You should fill this object the same way you would fill traits in an [identify call](/docs/connections/spec/identify/#traits). |
| `userAgent` | String  | User agent of the device making the request.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| `userAgentData` | Object | The user agent data of the device making the request. This always contains `brands`, `mobile`, `platform`, and may contain `bitness`, `model`, `platformVersion`,`uaFullVersion`, `fullVersionList`, `wow64`, if [requested](/docs/connections/sources/catalog/libraries/website/javascript/#client-hints) and available. <br><br> This populates if the [Client Hints API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/User-Agent_Client_Hints_API){:target="_blank"} is available on the browser. <br><br> This may contain more information than is available in the `userAgent` in some cases.                                                                                                                                |
| `channel`   | String  | where the request originated from: server, browser or mobile
