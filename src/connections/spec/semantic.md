title: 'Spec: Semantic Events'
---

One of the core components of the Segment [Spec](/docs/connections/spec) is the [Track](/docs/connections/spec/track) call. It describes any arbitrary event that the user has triggered. For some industry verticals and applications, Segment has standardized event names. For Ecommerce tracking, for example, there are **specific event names and properties** that we recognize semantically. This semantic meaning allows Segment to specially recognize and transform key events before sending them off to each different tool.

Segment currently standardizes event names and properties in the following places:

- [Mobile](/docs/connections/spec/mobile)
- [A/B Testing](/docs/connections/spec/ab-testing)
- [Ecommerce](/docs/connections/spec/ecommerce/v2/)
- [Email](/docs/connections/spec/email)
- [Live Chat](/docs/connections/spec/live-chat)
- [Video](/docs/connections/spec/video)
