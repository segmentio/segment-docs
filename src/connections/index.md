## Information on sources and destinations pages

The Sources and Destinations pages allow each user to decide what information appears in their personal view for each page.

On both pages, you can click the stack icon in the upper right-hand corner of the table to see and select Source properties to show. You can select up to five columns of properties.

The following information is available for Sources:

- Status
- Environment
- Destinations
- Type
- Category
- Created At
- Created By

On the Destinations page, you can choose among the following properties:

- Status
- Created At

You can then sort or filter each column to just the values you care about, by clicking on the arrow next to each displayed column.

## FAQs

### My source was disabled and it wasn't done by anyone in my workspace

Segment disables sources that don't have enabled destinations after 14 days, and emails you before disabling any sources. Disabling these sources helps maintain a clean workspace.

We do understand there maybe cases to keep a source active, if you'd like to add your source(s) to an exception list, you can do so by filling out this [airtable form](https://airtable.com/shr7V9LFDZh31cYWW).
