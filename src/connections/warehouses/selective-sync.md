title: Warehouse Selective sync
hidden: true
---

With Selective Sync, can configure which collections and properties from a source should sync to each warehouse. Previously, any changes made with this feature propagated across all warehouses within a workspace. Instead of all changes affecting every warehouse in a workspace, you can now use Selective Sync to decide which data should sync to each individual warehouse. This will allow you to send different sets of data to each warehouse.
