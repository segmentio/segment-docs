title: Data Storage overview
---

Segment offers several options for storing your Segment data. These include:

- Warehouses (SQL-based databases)
- Amazon S3 buckets for bulk storage
- Google Cloud Storage
- Data Lakes

<!-- TODO:

Need to write a section that explains: (Each of these could be a heading)

- What is a storage destination
- Why do you want one
- How do they work (streaming vs bulk loading)
- What types are available (and link to catalog)
- What's included in the free tier


then: add links to analytics academy stuff on owning your data
links to actual product pages
make sure there's a catalog entry for everything we're going to list here so it gets built
