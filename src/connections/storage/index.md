Off-the-shelf analytics tools (like Google Analytics and Mixpanel) offer quick and easy insights about common business questions, and often meet the needs of marketing teams and product managers. However, data analysts and data scientists need access to an organization's raw data to derive deeper and more customized insights to support their organization.

Segment offers several [Data Storage Destinations](/docs/connections/storage/catalog/) to help you store your raw Segment data, including:

- [Data Warehouses](/docs/connections/storage/warehouses/) (SQL-based databases, such as Postgres and Redshift)
- [Amazon S3](/docs/connections/storage/catalog/amazon-s3/)
- [Google Cloud Storage](/docs/connections/storage/catalog/google-cloud-storage/)
- [Segment Data Lakes](/docs/connections/storage/data-lakes/) (available to Business Tier customers only)

<!-- TODO:

Need to write a section that explains: (Each of these could be a heading)

- How do they work (streaming vs bulk loading) -- to be added later

make sure there's a catalog entry in warehouses.yml for everything we're going to list here so it gets built
