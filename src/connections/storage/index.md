---

Analytics tools such as Google Analytics and Mixpanel offer quick and easy insights about common business questions such as funnel conversion and product engagement. These often meets the needs of business teams such as Marketers and Product Managers. However Data Analysts and Data Scientists frequently look to derive deeper and often more custom insights to support advanced analytics and data science use cases, which require access to raw data.

Segment offers several options for storing your raw Segment data in flexible blob storage solutions. These Storage Destinations include:

- Data Warehouses (SQL-based databases)
- Amazon S3
- Google Cloud Storage
- Segment Data Lakes

> **Note**: Segment Data Lakes is available to Business tier customers only, while other Storage Destinations are available to all Segment customers.

<!-- TODO:

Need to write a section that explains: (Each of these could be a heading)

- What is a storage destination --added
- Why do you want one -- added
- How do they work (streaming vs bulk loading) -- to be added later
- What types are available (and link to catalog)
- What's included in the free tier -- added


then: add links to analytics academy stuff on owning your data
links to actual product pages
make sure there's a catalog entry for everything we're going to list here so it gets built
