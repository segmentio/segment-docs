Off-the-shelf analytics tools (like Google Analytics and Mixpanel) offer quick and easy insights about common business questions, and often meet the needs of marketing teams and product managers. However, data analysts and data scientists need access to an organization's raw data to derive deeper and more customized insights to support their organization.

make sure there's a catalog entry in warehouses.yml for everything we're going to list here so it gets built
