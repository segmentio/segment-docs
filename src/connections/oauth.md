title: OAuth 2.0
plan: oauth-2
---

OAuth 2.0 is an online authorization standard that uses tokens to grant access to API resources like Segmentâ€™s tracking API. You can use OAuth 2.0 as a security requirement for connections to third-party tools. 

## Permissions 
Depending on your workspace permissions, your access to OAuth apps is limited. 

Segment Role | Permission
------------ | -----------
Workspace Owner | You can view, create, and edit OAuth apps.
Workspace Member | You cannot view, create, or edit OAuth apps.
Source Admin | You can view and edit OAuth apps. <br> You can connect and disconnect OAuth apps. <br> You can enable or disable OAuth enforcement.
Source Read-only | You can only view OAuth apps.
Function Admin | You can view and edit OAuth apps. <br>You can connect and disconnect OAuth apps. <br>You can enable and disable OAuth enforcement.
Function Read-only | You can only view OAuth apps.

## Create an OAuth app

> info ""
> You must have already created a workspace in Segment to use OAuth.

To create a new OAuth application:

1. Navigate to **Settings > Workspace settings**  and select the Access Management tab. 
2. Select the **OAuth application** tab within the **Access Management** page. 
3. Click **Create OAuth app**.
4. Enter the configuration settings:

    Settings | Details
    -------- | -------
    Application name | The name of the OAuth app.
    Public key | Upload a public key in PEM format to authenticate through the OAuth application. You can upload a second public key after you create the OAuth application. You can create a public key by running the script: `openssl rsa -in private.pem -pubout -outform PEM -out public.pem`
    Public key name | Enter a name for your public key. 
    Token expiration period | You can choose between: 1 day, 2 days, 3 days, 1 week, 2 weeks, 3 weeks, 30 days.
    Scope | This specifies what type of access you need for each API. See the list of [supported scopes](#supported-scopes).
5. Click **Create**. 

Once you create your OAuth app, you can now connect a source to your OAuth app. 

## Connect a source to OAuth
> info ""
> OAuth only supports server-side sources. See the list of [supported sources](#supported-sources).

To connect a source to OAuth: 

1. Navigate to **Connections > Sources**.
2. Select the source you want to enable OAuth for. 
3. Go to the **Settings** tab of the source page and select **OAuth app**. 
4. Click **Connect OAuth app**. 
5. Select the OAuth app you want to connect the source to. 
6. Click **Connect**. 

To disconnect your source from OAuth, click **Disconnect**. 

## Enable a source to OAuth
Once you've connected your source to OAuth, you can enable it. To enable your source:

1. Navigate to **Connections > Sources** and select your source.
2. Go to the **Settings** tab of the source and select **OAuth app**.
3. Turn the toggle on for **Enable OAuth**. 

To disable your source from OAuth, turn the toggle off for **Enable OAuth**.

## Obtain the access token
You can obtain an access token once you create an OAuth application and enable a source to OAuth.  

Access tokens are only valid within a region. The supported regional authorization servers are: 
* Oregon - `https://oauth2.segment.io`
* Dublin - `https://oauth2.eu1.segmentapis.com`

To obtain the access token:

1. Create a JWT token with the header and payload as below:

    Header
    ```
    {
        "alg":"RS256", 
        "typ":"JWT", 
        "kid":"<<KID>>"
    }
    ```

    Payload
    ```
    {
        "iss":"<<ISS>>",
        "sub":"<<SUB>>",
        "aud":"<<AUD>>", 
        "iat":"<<IAT>>",
        "exp":"<<EXP>>",
        "jti":"<<JTI>>"
    }
    ```

    Field | Description 
    ------------ | -------------
    KID | The key ID of the public key in the OAuth application.
    ISS | The identifier of the JWT issuer.
    SUB | The OAuth application ID. 
    IAT | The epoch time in seconds when the token was issued. 
    EXP | The expiry time in seconds. This is expected to be valid only for a short duration under a minute. 
    JTI | The unique identifer for the token. 

2. Send a form-url-encoded `POST` request to the regional authorization server's `\token` route with the following parameters:
    
    ```
    grant_type=client_credentials
    client_assertion_type=urn:ietf:params:oauth:client-assertion-type:jwt-bearer
    client_assertion=<<JWT>>
    scope=<<SCOPE>>
    ```

    Field | Description
    ----- | ------------
    JWT | The signed JWT token string from Step 1.
    SCOPE | Scopes for which token is requested. See [supported scopes](#supported-scopes).

To use the access token, see an example of how to use the access token in the [HTTP API source](/docs/connections/sources/catalog/libraries/server/http-api/#oauth). 

## Edit an OAuth application
To edit an existing OAuth application: 

1. Navigate to **Settings > Workspace settings** and select the **Access Management** tab. 
2. Select the **OAuth application** tab within the **Access Management** page. 
3. Click the application name of the OAuth application you want to edit. 
4. On the **Overview** tab you can:
    * Revoke a token
    * Copy the Application ID and the Public key
    * Delete the OAuth application
5. Select the **Settings** tab on the right window where you can: 
    * Edit the **Application name**
    * Delete a public key
    * Add a new public key
    * Change the token expiration period
    * Edit your scope
6. Click **Save changes**. 


## Delete an OAuth app
> info ""
> To delete an OAuth app, you must remove all connected sources from the app. 

To delete an OAuth app: 
1. Navigate to **Settings > Workspace settings** and select the **Access Management** tab. 
2. Select the **OAuth application** tab within the **Access Management** page. 
3. Select the **App name** of the OAuth app you want to delete. 
4. Select **Delete OAuth app**.
5. Enter the name of the OAuth app you want to delete. 
6. Click **Delete OAuth app**. 

## Revoke a token

When security incidents expose access tokens, you can revoke your access token. To revoke a token: 
1. Navigate to **Settings > Workspace settings** and select the **Access Management** tab. 
2. Select the *OAuth application tab within the **Access Management** page. 
3. Select the **App name** with the token you want to delete. 
4. Enter the complete token
5. Click **Revoke token**.
