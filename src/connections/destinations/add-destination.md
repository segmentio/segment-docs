title: Sending Segment data to destinations
---

You've thought through and decided how you want to format your data, and collected it using Segment Sources. Now what do you do with it? Send the data on to Destinations!

Destinations are tools or services which can use the data sent from Segment to power analytics, marketing, outreach, and more.


## Adding a destination from the Segment web app

- from catalog

tied to workspace

add using api - tied to workspace by token

## Destination authentication

## Destination settings

## Multiple instances of the same destination

> note ""
> Multiple-destination support is available for all Segment customers on all plan tiers.

You can now connect a single Source to more than one instance of a destination. For example, if you have two different Google Analytics accounts for different parts of your business, but are using the same Library Source to track events, you might want to send that data to both Google Analytics accounts. This was not previously possible.
