Google’s [Display & Video (DV360)](https://marketingplatform.google.com/about/display-video-360/){:target="_blank"} is an end-to-end campaign management tool that enables enterprise customers to plan, measure, and run display and video advertisements. Segment’s integration with DV360 enables Segment customers to sync audiences created in Engage with DV360 for centralized audience management and improved retargeting.

This destination is different from the existing DV360 Actions as it allows you to upload [contact info](https://developers.google.com/display-video/api/reference/rest/v3/firstAndThirdPartyAudiences#ContactInfo){:target="_blank"} and the [mobile device ID](https://developers.google.com/display-video/api/reference/rest/v3/firstAndThirdPartyAudiences#mobiledeviceidlist){:target="_blank"}.

This destination can only be used with Engage. 

## Setup
Configuring this integration requires action by both you in your Segment workspace, and Google in your Google Marketing Platform account. As a result, the time required to finish configuration and setup can vary.

## Consent mode
[Consent mode](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/9976101?hl=en){:target="_blank"} is a feature provided by Google in the context of its products, particularly the Gtag library and Google Analytics. As of March 6, 2024, Google announced that consent mode must function for European Economic Area (EEA) users, otherwise data from EEA users won't process. 

Consent mode in the Gtag library and Google Analytics is designed to help website owners comply with privacy regulations, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the European Union. It allows website owners to adjust how these tools use and collect data based on user consent.

With consent mode, you can configure your website to dynamically adjust the tracking behavior of the Gtag library and Google Analytics based on the user's consent status. If a user provides consent to data processing, both the Gtag library and Google Analytics can collect and use that data for analysis. If a user doesn't provide consent, both tools limit data collection to essential functions, helping businesses respect user privacy preferences.

Segment automatically sends consent as `TRUE` for this destination.  Segment uses the [bulk-uploader workflow](https://developers.google.com/authorized-buyers/rtb/bulk-uploader#workflow){:target="_blank"} which requires consented data. Ensure all audiences and journeys are connected to consented audiences.

## FAQs

#### When will my data appear in DV360?
When you complete the connection between Segment and DV360, it can take from 24 to 48 hours for Google to create the user list. This must complete before Segment can begin to sync users into that list.
