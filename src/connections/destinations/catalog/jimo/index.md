Jimo supports the following methods, as specified in the [Segment Spec](/docs/connections/spec).

### Identify

Send [Identify](/docs/connections/spec/identify) calls to enrich your end-users data to help you target the right users based on their traits. For example:

analytics.identify("userId123", {
  email: "john.doe@example.com",
