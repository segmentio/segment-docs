## Getting Started

{% include content/connection-modes.md %}

1. From your Segment UI's Destinations page click on "Add Destination".
2. Search for "Elevio" within the Destinations Catalog and confirm the Source you'd like to connect to.
3. Drop in your "Account ID" from your Elevio's [Installation](https://app.elev.io/installation) page under "Install via Code Snippet". You can also utilize Elevio's "Install via Segment" workflow from the same page.
4. Ensure that you have Elevio's Assistant enabled via your [Settings](https://app.elev.io/settings).
5. In about 45 minutes the CDN will be updated and Elevio's snippet will be initialized onto your page.


## Identify

If you haven't had a chance to review our spec, please take a look to understand what the [Identify method](https://segment.com/docs/spec/identify/) does. An example call would look like:

```javascript
analytics.identify({
  name: 'Peter Gibbons',
  email: 'pgibbons@initech.com',
  plan: 'developer'
});
```

Passing in the `name`, `email` and `plan` traits allows you to send the user's information to Elevio and utilize the access control feature to restrict article access based on the email domain or plan, as well as identifying customers with live chat.
