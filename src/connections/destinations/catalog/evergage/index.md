## Identify
If you're not familiar with the Segment Specs, take a look to understand what the [Identify method](https://segment.com/docs/connections/spec/identify/) does. An example call would look like:

```javascript
analytics.identify('userId123', {
  name: 'John Doe',
  email: 'john.doe@example.com'
});
```

A `userId` is required on all `identify` calls sent to {{ integration.name}}. When you call `identify` Segment will call both `setUser` and `setUserField` in the [Evergage library](https://doc.evergage.com/display/EKB/Send+Data+to+Evergage) to insert both the `userId` and corresponding user traits into {{ integration.name}}.

## Group
If you're not familiar with the Segment Specs, take a look to understand what the [Group method](https://segment.com/docs/connections/spec/group/) does. An example call would look like:

```javascript
analytics.group('companyId123', {
  name: 'Segment'
});
```

A `groupId` is required on all `group` calls sent to {{ integration.name}}. When you call `group` Segment will call both `setCompany` and `setAccountField` in the [Evergage library](https://doc.evergage.com/display/EKB/Send+Data+to+Evergage) to insert both the `groupId` and corresponding group traits into {{ integration.name}}.

## Track
If you're not familiar with the Segment Specs, take a look to understand what the [Track method](/docs/connections/spec/track/) does. An example call would look like:

```javascript
analytics.track('Email Opened', {
  name: 'John Doe',
  email: 'john.doe@example.com'
});
```

When you call `track` Segment triggers `trackAction` in Evergage and will pass any properties with the event.
