[Google Analytics 4](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/10089681){:target="_blank"} is Google's new Analytics property, which you can use for both websites and applications. Google Analytics 4 has machine learning at its core to help surface insights and give you a more complete understanding of your customers across devices and platforms. 

When you have Segment installed, you can use your existing tracking implementation to fulfill your data collection needs with Google Analytics 4. When you enable the Google Analytics 4 Web destination, Segment loads the [gtag.js library](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/9310895?hl=en#zippy=%2Cin-this-article){:target="_blank"} for you. To avoid duplicate data, remove the native gtag.js script from your page.

> info "Consent mode"
> Google is enforcing consent starting March 6, 2024 for European Economic Area (EEA) users. Learn more about [consent mode](/docs/connections/destinations/catalog/actions-google-analytics-4-web/#consent-mode) and how to set it up. 

## Getting started

Before you connect Segment to Google Analytics 4, configure a Google Analytics 4 property in your Analytics account. For more information, see Google's article [Set up Analytics for a website and/or app](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/9304153){:target='_blank'}.

To connect the Google Analytics 4 Web destination: 

1. From the Segment web app, click **Catalog**, then click **Destinations**.
2. Search for “Google Analytics 4 Web” in the Destinations Catalog, and select the destination.
3. Click **Configure Google Analytics 4 Web**.
4. Select the web source that will send data to Google Analytics 4 and follow the steps to name your destination. The web source chosen must use [Analytics.js 2.0](/docs/connections/sources/catalog/libraries/website/javascript/).
5. On the **Settings** tab, under **Basic Settings**, enter in the [Measurement ID](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/9539598){:target='_blank'} associated with your GA4 web stream.
6. Set up your event mappings by following the steps in the Destinations Actions documentation on [Customizing mappings](/docs/connections/destinations/actions/#customizing-mappings).
7. Analytics.js requires an initial Page call to send data to Google Analytics 4 Web. The [Segment snippet](/docs/connections/sources/catalog/libraries/website/javascript/quickstart/#step-2-add-the-segment-snippet) includes this initial call by default.

After you've set up at least one event in your **Mappings** tab, you can see your events and parameters using the Google [Realtime](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/9271392){:target="_blank"} and [DebugView](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/7201382){:target="_blank"} reports. These two reports show you the events users trigger on your website as they occur. The DebugView report requires additional configuration before you can use it. 

Some parameters automatically populate prebuilt [dimensions and metrics](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/9143382){:target="_blank"} in Google Analytics. For example, the parameters on the automatically collected and enhanced measurement events and the required and optional parameters you send with the recommended events both populate pre-built dimensions and metrics.

### Recommended events

Google Analytics 4 requires the use of [recommended events](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/9267735){:target="_blank"} and properties to power certain built-in reports. Segment’s Google Analytics 4 Web destination provides prebuilt mappings to automatically map your Segment spec events to the corresponding Google Analytics 4 events and properties. If your Segment events don’t follow the Segment spec exactly, you can modify the mappings. For example, Segment maps `Order Completed` events to the Google Analytics 4 `Purchase` event by default. If your company uses `Products Purchase` to indicate a purchase, you can map it in the Purchase action’s Event Trigger instead.

Segment recommends using the prebuilt mappings when possible. However, the Segment spec doesn’t have an equivalent event for every Google Analytics 4 recommended event. If there are other recommended events you'd like to send, use the [Custom Event action](/docs/connections/destinations/catalog/actions-google-analytics-4-web/#custom-event). For example, to send a `spend_virtual_currency` event, create a mapping for Custom Event, set up your Event Trigger criteria, and input a literal string of `spend_virtual_currency` as the Event Name. You can use the Event Parameters object to add fields that are in the `spend_virtual_currency` event such as `value` and `virtual_currency_name`. Remember to define custom parameters as [custom dimensions and metrics](/docs/connections/destinations/catalog/actions-google-analytics-4-web/#custom-dimensions-and-metrics) in your GA4 workspace first.

### Custom events

Before you create a custom event, make sure the event you want to create isn't already collected through an [automatically collected event](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/9234069?sjid=7831609405656395105-NA){:target="_blank"} or recommended as a [recommended event](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/9267735?sjid=7831609405656395105-NA){:target="_blank"}. Segment recommends using an existing event, because these events automatically populate dimensions and metrics that are used in your reports.

Google Analytics 4 does not accept custom event names that include spaces. Segment replaces spaces in the Event Name in the Custom Event action with an underscore. As a result, you will see custom events snake cased in Google Analytics 4.

Event names are case-sensitive in Google Analytics 4. If you would like all event names to be lowercase, use the **Lowercase Event Name** setting when you create a Custom Event mapping and select `Yes` from the dropdown. If this setting is disabled, Google will treat event names with different casing as distinct events. 

Keep in mind that custom events will not appear in Google's standard reports; you will need to set up custom reports for meaningful analysis. 

### Custom dimensions and metrics

With Google Analytics 4, you must create custom dimensions and metrics within the Google Analytics 4 interface to link event parameters to the corresponding custom dimensions or metrics. When creating the dimension or metric, you can either select a parameter from the list of already collected fields or enter the name of the parameter you plan to collect in the future. For more information, see [Google Analytics 4 Custom dimensions and metrics](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/10075209?hl=en){:target="_blank"}.

### Understanding event parameters 

Parameters provide additional information about the ways users interact with your website. For example, when someone views a product you sell, you can include parameters that describe the product they viewed, like `product_name`, `category`, and `price`.

The automatically collected and enhanced measurement events include parameters by default. Google also provides a set of required and optional parameters to include with each recommended event. Additionally, you can add more event parameters when you need them.

### Conversion events

Some of Segment's prebuilt [Available Actions](/docs/connections/destinations/catalog/actions-google-analytics-4-web/#available-actions) which map to Google's recommended events are automatically marked as a conversion in your Analytics dashboard. For example, when you add a "Order Completed" event, it will show up in your Analytics dashboard as "purchase" with the **Mark as conversion** toggle toggled on by default. However, for other events, such as "Add to Cart", you will need to manually toggle the **Mark as conversion** setting on in your Analytics dashboard. If you don't mark the event as a conversion, it will not show up as a conversion in your built-in reports. You can read more [about conversion events](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/9267568?sjid=1275909514202748631-NA){:target="_blank"} in Google's docs. 

## Consent mode 
[Consent mode](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/9976101?hl=en){:target="_blank"} is a feature provided by Google in the context of its products, particularly the Gtag library and Google Analytics. As of March 6, 2024, Google announced that consent mode must function for European Economic Area (EEA) users, otherwise data from EEA users won't process. 

Consent mode in the Gtag library and Google Analytics is designed to help website owners comply with privacy regulations, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the European Union. It allows website owners to adjust how these tools use and collect data based on user consent.

With consent mode, you can configure your website to dynamically adjust the tracking behavior of the Gtag library and Google Analytics based on the user's consent status. If a user provides consent to data processing, both the Gtag library and Google Analytics can collect and use that data for analysis. If a user doesn't provide consent, both tools limit data collection to essential functions, helping businesses respect user privacy preferences. 

Consent mode may involve updates to your sources outside of Segment, such as incorporating a consent management system for consent functionality.

See [set up consent mode on websites](https://developers.google.com/tag-platform/security/guides/consent?consentmode=advanced#update_consent_state){:target="_blank"} for more information. 

### Set up consent mode

To enable consent mode for your Google Analytics 4 Web destination: 
1. Navigate to **Connections > Destinations** and select your Google Analytics 4 Web** destination. 
2. Go to the **Settings** tab of the destination.
3. Click the toggle on for **Enable Consent Mode**. 
4. Set the following fields with these values:

    Field | Value
    ----- | ------
    Default Ad Storage Consent State | Granted
    Default Analytics Storage Consent State | Granted
    Ad User Data Consent State | Granted
    Ad Personalization Consent State | Granted

5. Use your consent management platform to prompt the visitor. Ask the visitor to grant or deny consent for the applicable types.
6. Pass the updated state as properties in the `page()` event after the next page load if you decide to change the consent defaults. For example,

    ```
    analytics.page('Consent Update', {
        'Ads Storage Consent State': 'false',
        'Analytics Storage Consent State': 'false'
    });
    ```
7. As soon as the page loads and the set configuration fires to the Google Analytics SDK, Segment issues a consent mode update command. Map the properties you defined to collect consent state changes to the Set Configurations Fields mapping. You can choose to do this from 1 of 2 options in steps 4 and 5. 
        1. Navigate to **Connections > Destinations** and select your Google Analytics 4 Web destination. 
        2. Go to the **mappings** tab of the destination. 
        3. Select the mapping you want to edit.'
        4. *(Option 1)* Under the **Select mappings** section, select `Granted` for these fields:
            * Ads Storage Consent State
            * Analytics Storage Consent State
            * Ad User Data Consent State
            * Ad Personalization Consent State
            You can manually select `Granted` or `Denied` from the dropdown menu for Advanced consent mode settings, and type in `granted` or `denied` for basic consent mode settings.
        5. *(Option 2)* Under the **Select mappings** section, create an event variable to directly grab the value from the payload (for example, `properties.adStorageConsentState`). Ensure it translates to `granted` or `denied`. You can use an insert function to translate to `granted` or `denied`. Use the replace function if it's a string. Do this for these fields:
            * Ads Storage Consent State
            * Analytics Storage Consent State
            * Ad User Data Consent State
            * Ad Personalization Consent State

When these properties are available, they send to the `update` command.

## FAQ and troubleshooting

### Debug mode

The Google Analytics 4 [debug mode](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/7201382?hl=en){:target="_blank"} is supported with the Google Analytics 4 Web destination. DebugView displays the events and user properties that Analytics collects from a user in real-time. This can be helpful in troubleshooting your implementation.

### Send events from both the browser and the server 

With Google Analytics 4 Web, events are sent from the browser to GA4. If you use Segment’s [Google Analytics 4 Cloud destination](/docs/connections/destinations/catalog/actions-google-analytics-4/#benefits-of-google-analytics-4-cloud) to send events through the API and tie data between client-side and server-side, you need to pass the same Client ID from the browser and the server. To do this, fetch the Gtag-generated **clientId** on the web client and pass it to Segment as a property. For more information, see [Google Analytics 4 destination: User Identification](/docs/connections/destinations/catalog/actions-google-analytics-4/#user-identification) on the next steps.

### Additional (unmapped) events are sent to GA4

Google Analytics 4 collects events triggered by basic interactions with your site. For more information, see [Google Analytics 4 Automatically collected events](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/9234069?hl=en){:target="_blank"}

### Data takes a long time to appear in Google's reports

Google may take [24-48 hours](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/9333790){:target="_blank"} to process data sent to Google Analytics. As a result, the Google Analytics user interface may not reflect the most current data. The Google Analytics [Realtime report](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/9271392){:target="_blank"} displays activity on your site as it happens.

### Data is not sent to Google

For data to be sent downstream to Google Analytics, all of the following conditions must be met:

1. The **Set Configuration Fields** mapping must be configured and enabled in your mappings. This mapping is required for data to be sent downstream because it sets configuration to Measurement ID and establishes data flow using the `config` command.
2. The **Page Views** setting must be toggled on. When the **Page Views** setting is toggled on, a `page_view` event will be sent to Google Analytics 4 Web. If you're manually sending `page_view` events instead, see below for additional settings needed in your Analytics workspace. 
3. Ensure that you're calling `analytics.page()` on page load. Analytics.js requires an initial Page call to send data to Google Analytics 4 Web. The Segment snippet includes this initial call by default.

### Duplicate `page_view` events in GA4

If you are sending multiple `config` commands that your Google Tag has to account for, you may see duplicate `page_view` events in your Analytics workspace. If this is the case, please refer to Google's documentation on [Ignoring duplicate instances of on-page configuration](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/9973999?hl=en#:~:text=as%20described%20below.-,Ignore%20duplicate%20instances%20of%20on%2Dpage%20configuration,Click%20Save.,-Give%20feedback%20about){:target="_blank"}.

If you are manually sending `page_view` events, disable **Page changes based on browser history events** under the advanced settings of the **pageviews** section to avoid double counting pageviews on history state changes. More in Google's documentation on [Manual Pageviews](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/ga4/views?client_type=gtag#manual_pageviews){:target="_blank"}.

### Manually send `page_view` events

If you prefer to keep the **Page Views** setting disabled and manually send a `page_view`, please see this Google Doc for more on [Manual Pageviews](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/ga4/views?client_type=gtag#manually_send_page_view_events).

With Google Analytics 4 Web, you will need to configure a [Custom Event](/docs/connections/destinations/catalog/actions-google-analytics-4-web/#custom-event) mapping for manually sending `page_view` events. When mapping the events, please make sure to set the Event Name to `page_view`.

### Tracking UTM Parameters

UTM Parameters are automatically tracked and sent to Google when they are present in the URL. For example, with the following URL:
`https://www.example.com/?utm_content=email_variation1&utm_medium=email&utm_source=email_promo&utm_campaign=summer_sale&utm_id=abcd`

Without any further configuration, traffic-source data for `campaign`, `campaign_id`, `content`, `medium`, and `source` will populate in GA4. This can be observed on Google's side by triggering a `Page` call with UTM parameters present in the URL and navigating to the **Realtime overview** report in GA4 to see the resulting `page_view` event under the _Event count by Event name_ card. 

### Aquisition and Attribution in GA4

It's important to note that _Acquisition_ and _Attribution_ are two different things in GA4. _Acquisition_ is on the _User_ and _Session_ level, _Attribution_ is on the _Event_ level and determined by your [Reporting Identity](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/10976610?hl=en&sjid=5444376178412928264-NA){:target="_blank"} as well as your [Attribution Settings](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/10597962?hl=en&sjid=5444376178412928264-NA#zippy=%2Cin-this-article){:target="_blank"}, which are settings that are configured in your GA4 workspace outside of Segment. 
 
_Session source_ acquisition comes from [UTM parameters](https://segment-docs.netlify.app/docs/connections/destinations/catalog/actions-google-analytics-4-web/#tracking-utm-parameters){:target="_blank"}. _Attribution_ pertains to the conversion event that happened at the _Event_ level. That attribution is determined by your settings and the model that you choose. 
 
The `page_view` event is crucial for proper session attribution because attribution gets set on the first event after the config is loaded, which is usually a `page_view`.
 
More information available in Google's documentation on [Attribution and Attribution modeling](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/10596866?hl=en&sjid=7960067026404308955-NA#zippy=%2Cin-this-article){:target="_blank"} and [Campaigns and Traffic sources](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/11242841?hl=en&ref_topic=11151952&sjid=3843592966402957977-NA#zippy=%2Cin-this-article){:target="_blank"}. 

### Differences between Google Analytics 4 Cloud and Google Analytics 4 Web destinations 

Segment's [Google Analytics 4 Cloud](/docs/connections/destinations/catalog/actions-google-analytics-4/) server-side destination uses Google's Measurement Protocol API to send event data server to server, whereas Segment's [Google Analytics 4 Web](/docs/connections/destinations/catalog/actions-google-analytics-4-web/) device-mode destination loads the gtag.js library client-side and uses Segment's event data to map to gtag.js events directly. Each destination has its own advantages and disadvantages. Your choice between the two will depend on your specific use case, technical expertise, and the platforms from which you want to track data.
