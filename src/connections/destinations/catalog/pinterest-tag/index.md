## Getting Started

When you toggle on the Pinterest Tag in Segment, this is what happens:

+ Our CDN is updated within 5-10 minutes. Then our snippet will start asynchronously loading Pinterest Tag's tracking snippet onto your page. This means you should remove Pinterest Tag's snippet from your page.
+ Pinterest Tag will automatically start tracking visits and the defined events located on Pinterest Tag's documentation.

Here's how you can get started with using the Pinterest Tag!


### **1. Log into the Pinterest business account.**

In order to access the Pinterest Tag, you will need to have a Pinterest business account. If you don't yet have one, sign up for one [here](https://ads.pinterest.com/).


### **2. From the Ads menu, select Conversions.**

This will redirect to your Pinterest tags menu.

### **3. Find the Pinterest Tag ID.**

The Tag ID, if you have created one, is listed below the Tag Name.

If you haven't yet made a Pinterest tag, then select "Create Tag." Upon naming your new tag, you'll see the Tag ID under the Tag Name.


### **4. Activate the Pinterest Tag destination in Segment.**

Log into your Segment account, and go to the Destinations Catalog in the desired workspace and select the Pinterest Tag destination (located at `https://segment.com/<Your Workspace>/destinations/catalog/pinterest-tag`).

From there, select "Configure Pinterest Tag" and select the desired source to activate it for, and select "Confirm Source." The selected source will be loaded, and a sidebar will appear, asking for the Pinterest Tag ID.

Select that option and put in the Pinterest Tag ID that we collected earlier. Select "Save." In addition, one can optionally bind Segment track event names to specified Pinterest Event names. Details on that are provided below. In addition, Segment Track call properties can be added to this list to also be sent to Pinterest. Once ready, select "Activate Destination." Our servers will build the latest CDN, and the Pinterest Tag will then load on the sites that use that source's Segment snippet!


## Segment Event Mapping to Pinterest Event Types

Segment automatically binds the following Segment events to the Pinterest [Event Types](https://developers.pinterest.com/docs/ad-tools/conversion-tag/?#eventcode):

+ (Segment Spec Event => Pinterest Tag Event Type)
+ Products Searched => Search
+ Product List Filtered => Search
+ Product Added => AddToCart
+ Order Completed => Checkout
+ Video Playback Started => WatchVideo
+ `.page() call with no category` => PageVisit
+ `.page() call with category` => ViewCategory

In the Segment.com Pinterest Tag destination settings, one can define their own events for Pinterest Tag's `Signup`, `Lead`, and `Custom` events. Any events sent that aren't bound to any of these events will still be sent as a Partner-defined event. However, they will not be available for conversion tracking; only for audience creation.

## Segment Event Mapping to Pinterest Event Data

Segment automatically binds the following properties to Pinterest [Event Data](https://developers.pinterest.com/docs/ad-tools/conversion-tag/?#event-data-in-javascript):

+ (Segment Spec Property => Pinterest Tag Event Data)
+ query => search_query
+ order_id => order_id
+ coupon => coupon
+ value => value
+ currency => currency
+ `nested within the e-commerce products array: name` => product_name
+ `nested within the e-commerce products array: product_id` => product_id
+ `nested within the e-commerce products array: sku` => product_id
+ `nested within the e-commerce products array: category` => product_category
+ `nested within the e-commerce products array: variant` => product_variant
+ `nested within the e-commerce products array: price` => product_price
+ `nested within the e-commerce products array: quantity` => product_quantity
+ `nested within the e-commerce products array: brand` => product_brand

In the Segment.com Pinterest Tag destination settings, one can also define their own custom properties, in addition to the mapped properties above.
