If you're not familiar with the Segment Specs, take a look to understand what the [Page method](/docs/connections/spec/page/) does. An example call would look like:

```
analytics.page()
```

Page calls will be sent to WalkMe as a `pageview`.

```
analytics.identify('userId123', {
  email: 'john.doe@example.com'
});
```

Identify calls will be sent to WalkMe as an `identify` event.


## Track

If you're not familiar with the Segment Specs, take a look to understand what the [Track method](/docs/connections/spec/track/) does. An example call would look like:
