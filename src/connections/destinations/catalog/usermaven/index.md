## Benefits of Usermaven (Actions)

Usermaven (Actions) provides the following benefits:

- **Clear mapping of data.** Actions-based destinations enable you to define the mapping between the data Segment received from your source and the data Segment sends to Usermaven.
- **Pre-built mapping.** Mappings for Usermaven are prebuilt with the prescribed parameters and available for customization.
- **No 3rd party tool is involved.** Move the data directly from Segment to Usermaven without a 3rd party tool to facilitate the data sync.
- **Track events, identify users and companies.** You can track events, identify users and companies in Usermaven using Actions-based destinations.

<!-- The section below explains how to enable and configure the destination. Include any configuration steps not captured below. For example, obtaining an API key from your platform and any configuration steps required to connect to the destination. -->
