SimpleReach helps brands, agencies, and publishers increase the impact of their content marketing. The SimpleReach Destination is open-source. You can browse the code [on GitHub](https://github.com/segment-integrations/analytics.js-integration-simplereach).

## Getting Started



1.  From your Segment UI's Destinations page click on "Add Destination".
2.  Search for "SimpleReach" in the Catalog, select it, and choose which of your sources to connect the destination to.
3.  In your Segment Settings UI, enter your SimpleReach PID which was given to you by the SimpleReach client services team.

Your changes appear in the Segment CDN in about 45 minutes, and then Analytics.js starts asynchronously loading the SimpleReach snippet on your page and sending data.

Data then appears in your SimpleReach Dashboard.
