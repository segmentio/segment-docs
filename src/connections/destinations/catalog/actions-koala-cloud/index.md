> info "Cloud Mode Destination"
> This destination enables data transfer from Segment to Koala server-side. Additionally, Koala offers a device-mode destination that sends data directly from the browser using Koalaâ€™s SDK. For more information, see the [documentation](/docs/connections/destinations/catalog/actions-koala).

Koala enables you to identify website visitors with ease so you can turn traffic into actionable leads. See which companies are researching your docs, checking out your pricing page, and showing intent to buy.

Koala maintains this destination. For any issues with the destination, [contact the Koala Support team](mailto:support@getkoala.com).

## Getting Started

1. From the Segment web app, navigate to **Connections > Catalog > Destinations**.
2. Search for *Koala (Cloud)* and select **Add Destination**.
4. Select the source that will send data to Koala and follow the steps to name your destination.
5. On the **Settings** tab, input your **Public API Key** which can be found in your Koala workspace settings under **Settings > Install**.
6. Once connected, you can configure how you want to send data to Koala. By default, Segment forwards track events and identify events to Koala. Koala recommends sticking with the defaults.
