[AppFit](https://appfit.io/?utm_source=segmentio&utm_medium=docs&utm_campaign=partners){:target="_blank”} integrates with Segment to help teams stay on top of their key business metrics. Successful teams look at their app metrics on a consistent basis and use that data to make decisions about their business.

When you connect AppFit to your Segment account, you get a top level dashboard for your mobile phone and weekly reminders to review your metrics. If you see a metric that doesn't look right, AppFit lets you flag it and add comments so everyone can discuss what's going on right from their phone.

This destination is maintained by AppFit. For any issues with the destination, [contact their Support team](mailto:support@appfit.io).
