The Iterable Lists destination allows users to upload lists of users to Iterable, in the form of audiences. For more information on this destination's features, visit [Iterable's lists documentation](https://support.iterable.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000770906-Adding-Users-and-Creating-Lists){:target="_blank"}.

This is an [Engage Destination](/docs/engage/using-engage-data/#engage-destination-types-event-vs-list), which means it can be used to send data to Iterable Lists from Segment Engage Audiences.

## How it works

When you create an audience in Engage and connect it to the Iterable Lists destination, Segment automatically

1. Creates a new list in Iterable using the audience key as the list name.
2. Adds users to the list in Iterable when they enter the audience.
3. Removes users from the list in Iterable when they exit the audience.

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

* An Iterable API Key, which you can find in your Iterable account under **Settings > API Keys**;
* A configured [Engage Audience](/docs/engage/audiences/) that you want to connect to this destination.

### Connect Iterable Lists to Segment

1. From the Segment web app, go to **Engage > Engage Settings**.
2. Click on **Destinations**, then click on **Add Destination**.
3. Search for **Iterable Lists** and click on it.
4. Click on **Add destination**, then click on **Confirm Source**.
5. Under Basic Settings, enter a name for your destination (for instance, "Iterable Lists Prod Space"), your Iterable API Key, enable the destination, and click on **Save**.
6. In your audience, on the Destinations panel, click on **Add Destination** and select the Iterable Lists destination you just created;
7. Additional configurations can be provided in the destination settings, such as the Campaign ID, whether the unsubscribe operation is global, and whether only existing users can be updated in the list.
8. This destination supports the Identify and Tracks methods, having `Audience Entered` and `Audience Exited` as the default events.
9. This destination also supports a default setup (where `email` is considered as the primary identifier) or a custom setup (where you can define the primary identifier and additional fields to be sent to Iterable).
10. Click on **Save** to apply the changes, then click on **Add 1 Destination** to save the destination configuration.
11. Iterable Lists will appear under the Destinations table with 0 mappings. Click on the **Add mapping** button, that will open a side modal. On the side modal, click on **Add mapping**.
12. Click on **Sync to Iterable Lists** (the only Action available).
13. Under "Define event trigger", make sure to select the event the the proper conditions defined in the Destination Settings in the Audience, that will trigger the audience upload to Iterable Lists. It's a good practice to define a test event for the next mapping steps and testing.
14. If needed, you can define Linked Events enrichments under step 2, "Linked Events: enrich event stream with entities".
15. Under step 3 ("Map Fields"), you can map the event fields to Iterable fields, like `email`, `userId`, and additional fields.
16. Optionally, you can test the mapping by clicking on **Test Mapping**.
17. Click **Next**.
18. Under the last step ("Settings"), give this mapping a name, and click on **Save and enable**, if you want to enable the mapping right away, or **Save**, if you want to enable it later.
