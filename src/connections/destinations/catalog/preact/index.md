## Features

### Recording Errors

Preact can be really useful for customer support. For that to work well you'll want to send error events to Preact.

All you have to do is add a "!" as the first character in the event name and Preact will recognize it as an error event. Properties sent with the event will also show up in Preact.

Here's a javascript example:
```javascript
analytics.track('!Image upload error', {
    File size: '890kb',
    File extension: '.JPG',
    Message: 'File size too large'
    });
```
