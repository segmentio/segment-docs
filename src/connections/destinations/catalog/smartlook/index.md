## Identify

If you're not familiar with the Segment Specs, take a look to understand what the [Identify method](https://segment.com/docs/connections/spec/identify/) does.
Identify calls sent to Segment will be transformed and sent to [Smartlook's](https://smartlook.github.io/docs/web/identify-visitor/) `identify` method. An example call would look like:

```
analytics.identify('userId123', {
  email: 'john.doe@example.com'
});
```


## Track

If you're not familiar with the Segment Specs, take a look to understand what the [Track method](https://segment.com/docs/connections/spec/track/) does.
Track calls sent to Segment will be transformed and sent to [Smartlook's](https://smartlook.github.io/docs/web/custom-events/) `track` method.
An example call would look like:

```
analytics.track('banner_impression', {
    bannerName: 'sample_ad'
});
```
