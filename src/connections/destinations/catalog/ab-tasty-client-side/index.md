## Supported methods

AB Tasty supports the following methods, as specified in the [Segment Spec](/docs/connections/spec).

### Identify

Send [Identify](/docs/connections/spec/identify) calls to AB Tasty webhook. For example:

```js
analytics.identify('userId123', {
  email: 'john.doe@example.com',
  trait1: 1,
  trait2: "test",
  trait3: true
  },
});
```

Segment sends Identify calls to AB Tasty as an `identify` event. The AB Tasty data engine then ingests the different traits associated to the identified user.

Traits received are then available in the [AB Tasty segment builder](https://abtasty.zendesk.com){:target="_blank"}.

### Group

Send [Group](/docs/connections/spec/group) calls to AB Tasty webhook. The AB Tasty data engine then ingests the different traits associated to the identified group. For example:

```js
analytics.group("0e8c78ea9d97a7b8185e8632", {
  name: "Initech",
  industry: "Technology",
  employees: 329,
  plan: "enterprise",
  "total billed": 830,
});
```

Segment sends Track calls to AB Tasty as a `group` event. The AB Tasty data engine then ingests the different traits associated to the identified user.
