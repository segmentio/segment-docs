**As of November 2019, the Branch mobile SDKs for Segment are in maintenance mode.**

Existing users of the Branch SDKs are unaffected, however new installations must implement the Branch native SDK separately. They can then enable Branch's [data export integration](https://docs.branch.io/integrations/segment-export/) to push additional data to Segment, and [data import integration](https://docs.branch.io/integrations/segment-import/) to pull additional Segment data into the Branch dashboard.

The legacy instructions for implementing the Branch mobile SDKs for Segment have been removed from this documentation. If you need access to the removed sections, you can view them [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20191113225102//docs/connections/destinations/catalog/branch-metrics/).

This destination is maintained by Branch. For any issues with the destination, [contact the Branch support team](https://support.branch.io/support/home).

## Getting Started

{% include content/connection-modes.md %}

  1. From the Segment web app, click **Catalog**.
  2. Search for "Branch Metrics" in the Catalog, select it, and choose which of your sources to connect the destination to.
  3. On Branch side you will need to [sign up for a free Branch account](http://branch.io/signup?bmp=segment) and follow the steps on their Dashboard to complete set up.
  4. Copy your `Branch Key` from the Settings page of your [Branch dashboard](https://dashboard.branch.io/#/settings).
  5. Paste the Branch Key in the destination settings and click **Save**.


### Adding Branch device-mode SDKs for React Native

<!-- LR, Mar2021: this should be a `react-dest` include but Branch changed their name from Branch-Metrics-->

To add the Branch device-mode SDK to a [React Native](/docs/connections/sources/catalog/libraries/mobile/react-native/) project:
1. Navigate to the root folder of your project, and run a `yarn add branch` command to add the destination SDK to your project.
2. Add an `import` statement to your project, as in the example below.
   ```js
   import Branch from '@segment/analytics-react-native-branch'
   ```
3. In the same project file, add the destination to the `using` list in the `await` command.
   ```js
   await analytics.setup('YOUR_WRITE_KEY', {
     // Add any of your Device-mode destinations. This ensures they load before continuing.
     using: Branch
     // ...
   })
   ```
4. Finally, change to your iOS development folder ( `cd ios` ) and run `pod install`.



## Identify

If you're not familiar with the Segment Specs, take a look to understand what the [Identify method](/docs/connections/spec/identify/) does. An example iOS call would look like:
```swift
[[SEGAnalytics sharedAnalytics] identify:@"12091906-01011992"
                                traits:@{ @"email": @"john.doe@example.com" }];
```

## Track

If you're not familiar with the Segment Specs, take a look to understand what the [Track method](/docs/connections/spec/track/) does. An example iOS call would look like:

```swift
[[SEGAnalytics sharedAnalytics] track:@"Article Completed"
                           properties:@{ @"title": @"How to Create a Tracking Plan", @"course": @"Intro to Analytics" }];
```
