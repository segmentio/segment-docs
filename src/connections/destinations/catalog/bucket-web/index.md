Bucket maintains this destination. For any issues with the destination, [contact the Bucket Support team](mailto:support@bucket.co).


> warning ""
> If you are using both the Bucket Web (Actions) destination and the server side [Bucket destination](/docs/connections/destinations/catalog/bucket/) on the same source, avoid duplicate event tracking by disabling the "Track Event" mapping in Bucket Web (Actions).


## Benefits of Bucket Web (Actions) compared to Bucket Classic

Bucket Web (Actions) provides the following benefits over the classic Bucket destination:

- Clearer mapping of data. Actions-based destinations let you define the mapping between the data Segment receives from your source and the data Segment sends to the destination.
- Automatically enables [Live Satisfaction](https://bucket.co/live-satisfaction){:target="_blank"} prompts in your app, giving you fully-automated customer satisfaction scores and feedback on your features.


## Getting started

1. From the Destinations catalog page in the Segment App, click **Add Destination**.
2. Search for "Bucket Web" in the Destinations Catalog, and select the Bucket Web (Actions) destination.
3. Select a source to send data to the Bucket destination.
4. Go to [Bucket's Settings](https://app.bucket.co){:target="blank"} and find and copy the Publishable Key on the Tracking page.
5. Enter the Publishable Key as Publishable Key in the "Bucket Web (Actions)" destination settings in Segment.
