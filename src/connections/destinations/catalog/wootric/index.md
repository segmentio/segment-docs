## Getting Started

{% include content/connection-modes.md %}

1. From your Segment UI's Destinations page click on "Add Destination".
2. Search for "Wootric" within the Destinations Catalog and confirm the Source you'd like to connect to.
3. Drop in your Wootric "Account Token" in Segment's Settings UI. You can retrieve this from your Wootric Settings > Your unique Account Token is. It should look like "NPS-XXXXXXXX".
4. If you're using Segment's client-side `analytics.js` library, we asynchronously load Wootric's Javascript library onto the page and the CDN will be updated in 45 minutes.

### Mobile

1. For mobile implementations additional settings are required. Navigate to your Wootric Settings > API to add in your "Client ID" and "Client Secret" to the respective parts of the Segment Settings UI.

**IMPORTANT:**  The incoming responses and surveys will not be tied to a user until you [identify](https://segment.com/docs/destinations/wootric/#identify) your user.

## Page

If you haven't had a chance to review our spec, please take a look to understand what the [Page method](https://segment.com/docs/spec/page/) does. An example call would look like:

```javascript
analytics.page();
```

When you call `page` in the Javascript API, Wootric will log the page visit.


## Identify

If you haven't had a chance to review our spec, please take a look to understand what the [Identify method](https://segment.com/docs/spec/identify/) does. An example call would look like:

```javascript
analytics.identify('userId123', {
  email: 'hello@gmail.com',
  createdAt: '2018-08-03T15:28:46.493Z',
  language: 'EN'
});
```

When you call Identify, the user's information is passed to Wootric to check eligibility during survey responses. Segment's special traits recognized as Wootric's standard user profile fields (in parentheses) are:

| Segment Parameter  | Wootric Parameter                   | Description                          |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| `email`            | `wootricSettings.email`           | The email of this user.           |
| `createdAt`        | `wootricSettings.created_at` | ISO 8610 timestamp. Wootric requires the timestamp to be rounded to the nearest second so we will make this conversion for you. |
| `language`         | `wootricSettings.language`              | Language for Wootric's Net Promoter Score (NPS). |
