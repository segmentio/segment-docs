## Identify

If you haven't had a chance to review the Segment spec, please take time to review and to understand what the [`identify` method](/docs/connections/spec/identify/) does.

An example call can look like:

```js
analytics.identify('userId123', {
    property1: 1,
    property2: 'test',
    property3: true
});
```
The `userId` field, `userId123`, is mapped to the Business Key defined for the SMC database.

Identify calls will be sent to *Selligent Marketing Cloud* as an `identify` event.

## Track

If you haven't had a chance to review the Segment spec, please take time to review to understand what the [`track` method](/docs/connections/spec/track/) can do. 

An example call can look like:

```js
analytics.track('userId123', {
    property1: 1,
    property2: 'test',
    property3: true
});
```

Track calls will be sent to *Selligent Marketing Cloud* as a `track` event.

## Group

If you haven't had a chance to review the Segment spec, please take time to review to understand what the [`group` method](/docs/connections/spec/group/) can do. 

An example call can look like:

```json
{
  "type": "group",
  "groupId": "SegmentToSMCStatic",
  "userId": "segmenttest@selligent.com",
  "traits": {
    "matchkey": "MAIL",
    "method": "ADD",
    "userlist": "USERS_SEGMENT"
  }
}
```

Segment sends Group calls to *Selligent Marketing Cloud* as a `group` event. These calls are used to populate static segments in the *Selligent Marketing Cloud* platform. The static segment must be created in Selligent Marketing Cloud before you can use it. The call should adhere the above example and contain the following elements:
* <u>groupId</u>: The *api_name* of the static segment to populate
* <u>userId</u>: The value on which the matching to populate the segment should happen
* <u>traits</u>:
  * <u>matchkey</u>: this is a mandatory trait and should contain the name of the field in the userlist on which the matching should be done
  * <u>method</u>: this trait is optional and indicates either a remove call or an add call to the *Selligent Marketing Cloud* segment. The two values possible are REMOVE or ADD but it will default to ADD. So it’s only needed in case of a remove call
  * <u>userlist</u>: this is a mandatory trait and should contain the *api_name* of the userlist in *Selligent Marketing Cloud*

## Alias

If you haven't had a chance to review the Segment spec, please take time to review to understand what the [`alias` method](/docs/connections/spec/alias/) can do. 

An example call can look like:

```js
analytics.alias("507f191e81");
```

Track calls will be sent to *Selligent Marketing Cloud* as a `alias` event.

## Page

If you haven't had a chance to review the Segment spec, please take time to review to understand what the [`page` method](/docs/connections/spec/page/) can do. 

An example call can look like:
```js
analytics.page("Home");
```

Track calls will be sent to *Selligent Marketing Cloud* as a `page` event.



## Screen

If you haven't had a chance to review the Segment spec, please take time to review to understand what the [`screen` method](/docs/connections/spec/screen/) can do. 

An example call in Objective C can look like:

```obj-c
[[SEGAnalytics sharedAnalytics] screen:@"Home"
                            properties:@{ @"Feed Type": @"private" }];
```

Track calls will be sent to *Selligent Marketing Cloud* as a `screen` event.
