[FoxMetrics](https://www.foxmetrics.com/) is a personalization platform that allows users to collect & analyze customer actions through computers, mobile, and web applications. The `analytics.js` FoxMetrics destination is open-source. You can browse the code [on GitHub](https://github.com/segment-integrations/analytics.js-integration-foxmetrics).

## Getting Started

{% include content/connection-modes.md %}

1. From your Segment UI's Destinations page click on "Add Destination".
2. Search for "FoxMetrics" within the Destinations Catalog and confirm the Source you'd like to connect to.
3. Add your FoxMetrics `App ID`
4. When FoxMetrics in enabled in Segment, our CDN will update within 45 minutes, and FoxMetrics's javascript will be loaded asynchronously onto your page. Please remember to remove FoxMetrics's snippet from your page.

## Page

If you haven't had a chance to review our spec, please take a look to understand what the [Page method](https://segment.com/docs/connections/spec/page/) does. An example call would look like:

```
analytics.page();
```

When you call [`page`](/docs/connections/spec/page/), we call FoxMetrics' `record` with the exact same parameters.


## Identify

If you haven't had a chance to review our spec, please take a look to understand what the [Identify method](https://segment.com/docs/connections/spec/identify/) does. An example call would look like:

```
analytics.identify("97980cfea0067", {
  name: "Peter Gibbons",
  email: "peter@example.com",
  plan: "premium",
  logins: 5
});
```

When you call `identify` on `analytics.js`, we call FoxMetrics' `_fxm.visitor.Profile` to store all traits provided.


## Track
If you haven't had a chance to review our spec, please take a look to understand what the [Track method](https://segment.com/docs/connections/spec/track/) does. An example call would look like:

```
analytics.track("Registered", {
  plan: "Pro Annual",
  accountType: "Facebook"
});
```

When you call `track` on `analytics.js`, we push your event and properties onto the `_fxm` object.
