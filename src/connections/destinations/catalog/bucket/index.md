## Identify

If you aren't familiar with the Segment Spec, take a look at the [Identify method documentation](/docs/connections/spec/identify/) to learn about what it does. An example call would look like:

```js
analytics.identify('userId123', {
  name: 'John Doe',
  email: 'john.doe@example.com',
});
```

Segment sends Identify calls to Bucket as an `identify` event which updates User profiles.

## Group

```js
analytics.identify('groupId123', {
  name: 'Acme, Inc',
});
```

Segment sends Group calls to Bucket as a `group` event which updates Company profiles.

## Track

If you aren't familiar with the Segment Spec, take a look at the [Track method documentation](/docs/connections/spec/track/) to learn about what it does. An example call would look like:
