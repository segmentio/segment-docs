## Getting Started

{% include content/connection-modes.md %}

1. From your Segment UI's Destinations page click on "Add Destination".
2. Search for "CustomFit.ai" within the Destinations Catalog and confirm the Source you'd like to connect to.
3. Drop in the "Server Key" into your Segment Settings UI which you can find from your [CustomFit.ai dashboard](https://dashboard.customfit.ai/settings/app-settings).

## Identify

`Identify` lets you tie a user to their actions and record traits about them. It includes a unique User ID and any optional traits you know about them like their email, name, etc., Read more about the [Identify method](https://segment.com/docs/connections/spec/identify/) to understand what it does. An example call would look like:

```js
analytics.identify("user_id", {
  name: "Peter Gibbons",
  email: "peter@example.com",
  plan: "premium",
  logins: 5
});
```
Segment handles the following mapping:
1. Segment `identify` event userId to CustomFit.ai `user_customer_id` field.
2. Segment `identify` event traits to CustomFit.ai `properties`.

Identify calls will be sent to CustomFit.ai as an `identify` event. You can find the user details in [users profile page](https://dashboard.customfit.ai/users/profiles).

## Track

The `track` API call is used to record any actions your users perform, along with any properties that describe the action. Each action is known as an event. Read more about the [Track method](https://segment.com/docs/connections/spec/track/) to understand what it does. An example call would look like:

```js
analytics.track("Registered", {
  user_id : "97980cfea0067",
  plan: "Pro Annual",
  accountType: "Facebook"
});
```
Segment handles the following mapping:
1. Segment `track` event to CustomFit.ai `event_customer_id`.
2. Segment `track` event userId to CustomFit.ai `user_customer_id`.
3. Segment `track` event properties to CustomFit.ai event `data`

> Note : We expect `identify` event to be invoked before `track` event for a particular user.
>

Track calls will be sent to CustomFit.ai as an `track` event. You can find the user level track details under events tab of user profile.

## Page

```js
analytics.page("Home", {
  title : "CustomFit.ai",
  url : "http://customfit.ai"
});

The `screen` call lets you record whenever a user sees a screen, the mobile equivalent of page, in your mobile app, along with any properties about the screen. Read more about the [Screen method](https://segment.com/docs/connections/spec/screen/) to understand what it does. An example call would look like:

```objc
[[SEGAnalytics sharedAnalytics] screen:@"Home"
                            properties:@{ @"Feed Type": @"private" }];
