## Supported methods

Aampe supports the following methods, as specified in the [Segment Spec](/docs/connections/spec).

### Track

Segment sends [Track](/docs/connections/spec/track) calls to Aampe as a `track` event. These are used by Aampe to display engagement activity and reports in the [Aampe Composer](https://compose.aampe.com). You can use these to configure goals that are used for monitoring and creating campaigns. It may take up to 24 hours for events to show up in the Aampe Composer.

```js
analytics.track("Login Button Clicked");
```

Segment sends Track calls to Aampe as a `track` event.

Other methods like Page, Screen, and Identify are accepted by the Aampe destination but are not stored or used in any way.
