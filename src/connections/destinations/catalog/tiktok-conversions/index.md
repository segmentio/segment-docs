The TikTok Conversions destination is a server-to-server integration with the TikTok Events API that allows advertisers to share website visitor events from Segment directly to TikTok. Data shared through the Events API is processed similarly to information shared through the TikTok pixel and TikTok SDK business tools. Advertisers can use events data to power solutions like dynamic showcase ads (DSA), custom targeting, campaign optimization and attribution. Advertisers can see their event data in TikTok Events Manager.

The TikTok Conversions destination is owned and maintained by the TikTok team.

## Benefits of TikTok Conversions
The TikTok Conversions destination provides the following benefits:

1. **Clear mapping of data.** Actions-based destinations enable you to define the mapping between the data Segment receives from your source and the data Segment sends to TikTok.
2. **Prebuilt mappings.** Mappings for TikTok Standard Events, like `PlaceAnOrder`, are prebuilt with the prescribed parameters and available for customization.
3. **Streamlined stability and security.** Integrate and iterate without client-side limitations, like network connectivity or ad blocker issues.
4. **Privacy-focused**: Stay compliant with rapidly evolving requirements with automatic PII hashing and flexible controls that let you adapt what data you share.
5. **Maximum event measurement**: Capture more events with improved accuracy across different browsers, apps, and devices to get a unified view of your customer's journey from page view to purchase.

## FAQ & Troubleshooting

### Match Keys

To increase the probability of matching website visitor events with TikTok ads, please send one or more of the following match keys and identifiers when possible:
- TikTok Click ID
- External ID
- Phone Number
- Email
- IP Address
- User Agent

### Other Standard Events

If you want to send a [TikTok standard event](https://ads.tiktok.com/marketing_api/docs?id=1701890979375106){:target="_blank"} that Segment doesn't have a prebuilt mapping for, you can use the [Report Web Event action](/docs/connections/destinations/catalog/tiktok-conversions/#report-web-event) to send the standard event. For example, if you want to send a `CompleteRegistration` event: 
1. Create a mapping for Report Web Event. 
2. Set up your Event Trigger criteria for completed registrations. 
3. Input a literal string of "CompleteRegistration" as the Event Name.

### PII Hashing

Segment creates a SHA-256 hash of the following fields before sending to TikTok:
- External ID
- Email
- Phone Number

### Web Diagnostics

You can check whether the integration is working, test events in real-time, and troubleshoot common issues in TikTok’s Web Diagnostics Suite. Please see the [TikTok Pixel Web Diagnostics documentation](https://ads.tiktok.com/help/article?aid=10000360){:target="_blank"} for more information.
