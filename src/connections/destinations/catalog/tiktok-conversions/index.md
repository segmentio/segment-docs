The TikTok Conversions Destination enables advertisers to send Segment events to report events directly to TikTok. Data shared can power TikTok solutions like dynamic product ads, custom targeting, campaign optimization and attribution.

Reporting web events allows advertisers to send user data directly to TikTok for downstream targeting and optimization. Advertisers will be able to see their event data in TikTok Events Manager.
