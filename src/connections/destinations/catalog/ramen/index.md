title: Ramen Destination
---

## Getting Started
​
When you toggle on Ramen in Segment, this is what happens:
​
+ Our CDN is updated within 45 minutes. Then our snippet will start asynchronously loading Ramen's JavaScript library onto your page. This means you should remove Ramen's snippet from your page if you already have it there.
​
+ As of March 2016, Ramen supports asking questions of anonymous website visitors in addition to logged-in users. Calling [`page`](#page), [`track`](#track), and [`group`](#group) will work without calling [`identify`](#identify). However, when you call [`identify`](#identify) you _must_ pass in an `id` or else the Ramen destination will ignore the call.

​
## Identify
​
When you call [`identify`](/docs/spec/identify) on Analytics.js, it identifies the logged-in user to Ramen.
​
Here is a full example, which we will annotate below:
​
```javascript
analytics.identify('314159', {
  email: 'ryan@charturl.com',
  name: 'Ryan Angilly',
  created_at: 1234567890,
  is_profitable: true,
  plan: 'Startup',
  mrr: 149.99
});
```
​
Here is a list of the attributes we process:
​
* `id` becomes the `id` of the user in Ramen.
* `email` becomes the `email` of the user in Ramen.
* `name` becomes the `name` of the user in Ramen.
* `created_at` becomes the `customer_created_at` timestamp for the user in Ramen. It can be passed in as a `Date` or seconds since the epoch.
* If `company` is an `Object` with an `id` attribute, we'll treat that information as if it was passed to [`group`](#group) and create a company in Ramen.
* Attributes with names ending in `_at` will be parsed as times.
* Attributes with names beginning with `is_` will be parsed as Booleans.
​
​
**Note:** Ramen will ignore any calls to `identify` that do not contain `userId`.
​
​
​
## Group
​
Segment supports Ramen Companies in Analytics.js through the [`group`](/docs/spec/group) method. Users can be put into multiple groups, which will associate them to multiple companies in Ramen.
​
Here is a full example, which we will annotate below:
​
```javascript
analytics.group('314159', {
  name: 'Ryan Angilly',
  url: 'https://charturl.com',
  created_at: 1234567890,
  is_awesome: true,
  plan: 'Startup',
  mrr: 149.99
});
```
​
Here is a list of the attributes we process:
​
* `id` becomes the `id` of the company in Ramen.
* `url` becomes the `url` of the company in Ramen.
* `name` becomes the `name` of the company in Ramen.
* `created_at` becomes the `company_created_at` timestamp for the company in Ramen. It can be passed in as a `Date` or seconds since the epoch.
* Other attributes can be passed in as well, and will parsed according to the same rules as denoted in the [`identify`](#identify) section.
​
​
## Page
​
When you call [`page`](/docs/spec/page) on Analytics.js, it registers a new pageview in Ramen and checks to see if any questions should be asked.
​
Ramen does not support passing in any attributes to `page`. You can call `page({ title: "Our page" })` but the attributes (ie. `title` in this example) will be ignored.
​
​
## Track
​
When you call [`track`](/docs/spec/track) on Analytics.js, it registers a new event in Ramen and checks to see if any questions should be asked.
​
Ramen does not support passing in any attributes to `track` beyond the event name. You can call `track('Subscribed', { plan: "Startup" })` but the attributes (ie. `plan` in this example) will be ignored.

## Features
​
​
### Secure Mode
​
If you want to enable Ramen [secure mode](http://docs.ramen.is/#secure-mode) for analytics.js, you can pass in the `timestamp` and `auth_hash` variables by rendering it in your server-side templates.
​
The `timestamp` should be a Unix timestamp (epoch seconds). The `auth_hash` is a SHA256 has of several attributes. The hash is not based on the email, it is based on:
​
+ user.email - If you do not store emails for your customers, use an empty string
+ user.id
+ user.name - If you do not have a name for your customers, use their email address or an empty string
+ timestamp
+ Ramen API Secret
​
Here's an example of a Ruby web server rendering an identify call with secure mode:
​
```ruby
analytics.identify('<%= current_user.id %>', {
    email   : '<%= current_user.email %>',
    createdAt : <%= current_user.created_at.to_i %>
}, {
    integrations: {
        Ramen : {
            timestamp: <%= @ts ||= Time.now.to_i %>,
            auth_hash : '<%= (Digest::SHA256.new << "#{current_user.email}:#{current_user.id}:#{current_user.name}:#{@ts}:RAMEN_ORGANIZATION_SECRET_KEY").to_s %>'
        }
    }
});
```
​
`RAMEN_ORGANIZATION_SECRET_KEY` is found in Ramen's RamenJS documentation.

## Troubleshooting
​
​
### I'm seeing a `404` error
​
Check to make sure your Ramen `ORGANIZATION_ID` is correct.
​
### I'm seeing a `401` error
​
The request you are sending is not valid. Several things can cause this:
​
+ An invalid `user.email`. It can be blank, but it cannot be an invalid email address.
+ A missing `user.id`.
+ Not including `timestamp` and `auth_hash` once Secure Mode has been enabled. You can see if Secure Mode is enabled by visiting your RamenJS settings page in Ramen.
​
If the above all look correct, and you are sending `timestamp` and `auth_hash`, check the following:
​
+ `timestamp` is being dynamically generated (ie. it is not accidentally hard-coded).
+ `auth_hash` is being calculated correctly
​
If you are still having trouble, you can email [Ramen support](mailto:support@ramen.is).
