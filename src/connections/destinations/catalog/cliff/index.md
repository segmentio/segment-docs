[Cliff](https://cliff.ai/?utm_source=segmentio&utm_medium=docs&utm_campaign=partners) monitors all your metrics in real time, detects unexpected changes (such as a sudden spike or dip), and notifies you immediately. It also shows you the root cause behind the unexpected change.

This destination is maintained by Cliff.ai. For any issues with the destination, [contact the Cliff Support team](mailto:support@cliff.ai).
