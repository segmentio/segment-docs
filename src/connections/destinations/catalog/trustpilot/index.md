## Track

If you're not familiar with the Segment Specs, take a look to understand what the [Track method](https://segment.com/docs/connections/spec/track/) does. An example call would look like:

```
analytics.track('Order Completed', {
  checkout_id: 'fksdjfsdjfisjf9sdfjsd9f',
  order_id: '50314b8e9bcf000000000000',
  email: 'test@example.com',
  name: 'John',
  surname: 'Johnson',
  affiliation: 'Google Store',
  total: 27.50,
  revenue: 25.00,
  shipping: 3,
  tax: 2,
  discount: 2.5,
  coupon: 'hasbros',
  currency: 'USD',
  products: [
    {
      product_id: '507f1f77bcf86cd799439011',
      sku: '45790-32',
      name: 'Monopoly: 3rd Edition',
      price: 19,
      quantity: 1,
      category: 'Games',
      url: 'https://www.example.com/product/path',
      image_url: 'https:///www.example.com/product/path.jpg'
    },
    {
      product_id: '505bd76785ebb509fc183733',
      sku: '46493-32',
      name: 'Uno Card Game',
      price: 3,
      quantity: 2,
      category: 'Games'
    }
  ]
});
```

Trustpilot accepts only `Order Completed` events. These Track calls will be sent to Trustpilot as a `track` event and create a review invitation.

**IMPORTANT:** Both `order_id` and `email` are required fields.
