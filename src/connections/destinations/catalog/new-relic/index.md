## Getting Started

{% include content/connection-modes.md %}

  1. From your Segment UI’s Destinations page click on "Add Destination".
  2. Search for "New Relic" within the Destinations Catalog and confirm the Source you’d like to connect to.
  3. Drop in your Insights [Account ID](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/accounts/install-new-relic/account-setup/account-id) and your [Insert Key](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/insights/insights-data-sources/custom-data/insert-custom-events-insights-api#register).
  4. Once destination enabled we'll start forwarding your calls to New Relic.

## Track

If you haven't had a chance to review our spec, please take a look to understand what the [Track method](https://segment.com/docs/spec/track/) does. An example call would look like:
```
analytics.track('Article Completed', {
  title: 'How to Create a Tracking Plan',
  course: 'Intro to Analytics',
});
```

We forward `track` calls to New Relic in order to [insert custom events via their Insights API](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/insights/new-relic-insights/adding-querying-data/inserting-custom-events).

Your event `properties` will be included with the event, conforming to the following rules:
- booleans are transformed to strings
- reserved nrql words are wrapped with backticks
- reserved words are removed
- dates are converted to ISO strings
- arrays and objects are removed

By default the events are given an `eventType` of 'Segment'. This can be changed via the optional 'Custom Default Event Type' setting in the Segment UI.

If you pass a revenue property, we'll pass that through as the value of the conversion.
