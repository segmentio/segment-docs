[Hotjar](https://help.hotjar.com/hc/en-us) is the fast & visual way to understand your users. It offers a full set of user experience tools: heatmaps, session recordings, forms reporting, funnels, and feedback tools, giving you everything your team needs to uncover user insights and make the right changes.

The Segment Hotjar Destination allows you to both easily install Hotjar on your pages, and send [User Attributes](https://help.hotjar.com/hc/en-us/articles/360038394053-How-to-Setup-User-Attributes-in-4-Steps) information over Hotjar’s [Identify API](https://help.hotjar.com/hc/en-us/articles/360033640653) using the Segment Identify Spec. As of February 3rd, 2020, this allows you to:

* [Target Polls and Incoming Feedback to users based on their User Attributes](https://help.hotjar.com/hc/en-us/articles/360022688554)
* [Lookup and Delete user data based on their User ID](https://help.hotjar.com/hc/en-us/articles/360001749014)

In time, most or all Hotjar features will use User Attributes in some way, with filtering Recordings planned in the first half of 2020.

## Getting Started

{% include content/connection-modes.md %}

1. From your Segment UI's Destinations page click on "Add Destination".

2. Search for "Hotjar" within the Destinations Catalog and confirm the Javascript source you'd like to connect to.

3. Add your Hotjar Site ID to your Destination settings. You can find this under Settings and Sites & Organizations in your Hotjar dashboard. It should be a whole number (e.g. 123456).

4. We'll automatically load Hotjar's tracking snippet, along with your Site ID, onto the page once analytics.js loads. If you are already using Hotjar, please remove Hotjar’s snippet from your code.

5. Once our CDN updates in 45 minutes, Hotjar will automatically start tracking visitors based on the tools you have enabled in your Hotjar dashboard.

## Identify

The Hotjar destination will automatically ingest a User ID, as well as values sent over your Identify spec as [traits](https://segment.com/docs/connections/spec/identify/#traits), as long as [User Attributes are enabled in Hotjar](https://help.hotjar.com/hc/en-us/articles/360038394053-How-to-Setup-User-Attributes-in-4-Steps#step-2-review-your-privacy-requirements-and-enable-user-attributes). 

### Nested values or lists

The Hotjar Identify API is unable to ingest values passed as nested objects or lists over your `identify` Spec:

```js
"traits": {
    "name": "Peter Gibbons",
    "email": "peter@initech.com",
    "plan": "premium",
    "logins": 5,
    "address": {
      "street": "6th St",
      "city": "San Francisco",
      "state": "CA",
      "postalCode": "94103",
      "country": "USA"
    }
```

In this example, Hotjar would reject all the values in the `address` field. 

This is a recognized limitation of this version of the Hotjar Identify API, and as of February 3rd, 2020, is in the improvements backlog for the API.
