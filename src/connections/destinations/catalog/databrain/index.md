[DataBrain](https://usedatabrain.com/?utm_source=segmentio&utm_medium=docs&utm_campaign=partners) is a tool for product-led companies that helps Sales and Customer Success teams close deals, increase product adoption, and retain customers. DataBrain ingests data from Segment and leverages machine learning techniques to send users automated alerts, and predict churn, conversion, and retention on any event you need to track.

> You should see data in DataBrain within 48 hours. DataBrain notifies you by email when your model is generated.

*Optional:* You can use Segment [Replays](/docs/guides/what-is-replay/) to sync your past events which were sent through Segment into your DataBrain instance.

## Page

If you're not familiar with the Segment Specs, take a look to understand what the [Page method](/docs/connections/spec/page/) does. An example call would look like:

```js
analytics.page()
```

Segment sends Page calls to DataBrain as a `pageview`.

## Identify

If you're not familiar with the Segment Specs, take a look to understand what the [Identify method](/docs/connections/spec/identify/) does. An example call would look like:

```js
analytics.identify('userId123', {
  email: 'john.doe@example.com'
});
```

Segment sends Identify calls to DataBrain as an `identify` event.

## Track

If you're not familiar with the Segment Specs, take a look to understand what the [Track method](/docs/connections/spec/track/) does. An example call would look like:

```js
analytics.track('Login Button Clicked')
```

Segment sends Track calls to DataBrain as a `track` event.

## Screen

If you're not familiar with the Segment Specs, take a look to understand what the [Screen method](/docs/connections/spec/screen/) does. Below are two example calls:

```objc
[[SEGAnalytics sharedAnalytics] screen:@"Home"];
```

```js
{
  "type": "screen",
  "name": "Home",
  "properties": {
    "Feed Type": "private"
  }
}
```
Segment sends Screen calls to DataBrain as a `screenview`.

## Group

```js
{
  "type": "group",
  "groupId": "0e8c78ea9d97a7b8185e8632",
  "traits": {
    "name": "FooBar",
    "industry": "Insurance",
