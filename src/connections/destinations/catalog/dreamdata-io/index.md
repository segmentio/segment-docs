## Page

If you're not familiar with the Segment Specs, take a look to understand what the [Page method](/docs/connections/spec/page/) does. An example call would look like:

```
analytics.page()
```

Page calls will be sent to [Dreamdata](https://dreamdata.io/?utm_source=segmentio&utm_medium=docs&utm_campaign=partners) as a `pageview`.


## Screen

If you're not familiar with the Segment Specs, take a look to understand what the [Screen method](/docs/connections/spec/page/) does. An example call would look like:

```
[[SEGAnalytics sharedAnalytics] screen:@"Home"];
```

Screen calls will be sent to [Dreamdata](https://dreamdata.io/?utm_source=segmentio&utm_medium=docs&utm_campaign=partners) as a `screenview`.


## Identify

If you're not familiar with the Segment Specs, take a look to understand what the [Identify method](/docs/connections/spec/identify/) does. An example call would look like:

```
analytics.identify('userId123', {
  email: 'john.doe@example.com'
});
```

Identify calls will be sent to [Dreamdata](https://dreamdata.io/?utm_source=segmentio&utm_medium=docs&utm_campaign=partners) as an `identify` event.


## Track

If you're not familiar with the Segment Specs, take a look to understand what the [Track method](/docs/connections/spec/track/) does. An example call would look like:

```
analytics.track('Clicked Login Button')
```

Track calls will be sent to [Dreamdata](https://dreamdata.io/?utm_source=segmentio&utm_medium=docs&utm_campaign=partners) as a `track` event.


## Group

If you're not familiar with the Segment Specs, take a look to understand what the [Group method](/docs/connections/spec/group/) does. An example call would look like:

```
analytics.group("userId123", {
  name: "Initech",
  industry: "Technology",
  employees: 329,
  plan: "enterprise"
});
```

Group calls will be sent to [Dreamdata](https://dreamdata.io/?utm_source=segmentio&utm_medium=docs&utm_campaign=partners) as a `group` event where it is used to join users to accounts.

By default, [Dreamdata](https://dreamdata.io/?utm_source=segmentio&utm_medium=docs&utm_campaign=partners) uses user emails and your CRM data to map user activites to accounts and attribute the value correctly. Adding Group calls using Segment will give a more precise attribution and ensure that all activities are attributed to the right account.
