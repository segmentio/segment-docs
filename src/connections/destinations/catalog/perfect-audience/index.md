[Perfect audience](http://www.perfectaudience.com/) is a retargeting platform that lets marketers bring back lost web visitors through Facebook ads and banner ads in the web.

## Getting Started

{% include content/connection-modes.md %}

1. From your Segment UI's Destinations page click on "Add Destination".
2. Search for "Perfect Audience" within the Destinations Catalog and confirm the Source you'd like to connect to.
3. Add your `Advertiser ID` (located in the User tracking session in Perfect Audience) and enable the destination in Segment.
4. We'll automatically start recording data.

When Perfect Audience in enabled in Segment, our CDN will update within 45 minutes, and Perfect Audience's javascript is asynchronously loaded onto your page. Remember to remove Perfect Audience's snippet from your page.

Perfect Audience is only supported on the client-side.

## Track

If you're not familiar with the Segment Specs, take a look to understand what the [Track method](https://segment.com/docs/connections/spec/track/) does. An example call would look like:

```javascript
analytics.track("My Custom Event", {
  checkinDate: new Date(),
  myCoolProperty: "foobar",
});
```

When you call `track` on analytics.js, we call Perfect Audience's `track` with the exact same parameters.

Perfect Audience requires that you define your goals ahead of time in their interface. If that hasn't happened, then they don't track the events.

[Here's their video of how to set that up](http://support.perfectaudience.com/knowledgebase/articles/234037-how-to-create-and-track-conversion-goals-with-perf) - you'll need to match event names between Perfect Audience and your Segment track calls.


### Order Completed

If you're using our [ecommerce spec](/docs/connections/spec/ecommerce/v2/) and passing the `Order Completed` event the `orderId` and `total` will be passsed along to Perfect Audience.
