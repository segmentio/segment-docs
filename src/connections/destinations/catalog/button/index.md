## Track
If you aren't familiar with the Segment Spec, take a look at the [Track method documentation](/docs/connections/spec/track/) to learn about what it does. An example call would look like:

```js
analytics.track('Deep Link Opened')
```

Segment sends Track calls to Button as a `track` event.

### Deep links
To track deep links from your app or website, use Segment's [Deep Link Opened](/docs/connections/spec/mobile/#deep-link-opened) and [Application Opened](/docs/connections/spec/mobile/#application-opened) events.

Make sure you pass the referring URL. An example would look like:

```js
analytics.track('Application Opened' { someProperty: true }, {
  userId: '1234567890',
  properties: {
    url: 'brand-app://?btn_ref=srctok-XXX'
  }
  ...
})
```

> success ""
> **Tip!** Make sure you record any different names for `Deep Link Opened` Track events across your sources so you know which are sent where.

### Installs
To track mobile app installs, use Segment's [Application Installed](/docs/connections/spec/mobile/#application-installed) event.

Capture the referring URL when possible. An example would look like:

```js
analytics.track('Application Installed' { someProperty: true }, {
  userId: '1234567890',
  properties: {
    url: 'https://brand-homepage.com?btn_ref=srctok-XXX'
  },
  context {
    app: { version: '4.15.0' },
    device: {
      adTrackingEnabled: false,
      advertisingId: 'XXXXXXXX-YYYY-ZZZZ-1111-222222222222'
    },
    ip: '127.0.0.1',
    locale: 'en-US',
    os: {
      name: 'iOS',
      version: '14.2'
    }
  }
  ...
})
```
> success ""
> **Tip!** Make sure you record any different names for `Application Installed` Track events across your sources so you know which are sent where.

### Orders
To track `order` events from your app or website, use Segment's [Order Completed](/docs/connections/spec/ecommerce/v2/#order-completed) event.

An example call would look like:

```js
analytics.track('Order Completed' { someProperty: true }, {
  userId: '1234567890',
  properties: {
    subtotal: 7500,
    products: [
      {
         sku: 'sku-123',
         description: 'T-Shirt',
         size: 'L',
         price: 2500,
         quantity: 1,
         category: 'Clothing',
      },
      {
         sku: 'sku-456',
         description: 'Joggers',
         size: 'M',
         price: 5000,
         quantity: 1,
         category: 'Clothing',
      }
    ]
  }
})
```
> success ""

## Setting up a Destination Filter

If you are a Business Tier customer, you can set up a [Destination Filter](/docs/connections/destinations/destination-filters/) to only send your `Deep link` and `Order` events to Button.


Read [Button's Destination Filter documentation](https://developer.usebutton.com/docs/segment-integration-guide) to learn more.
