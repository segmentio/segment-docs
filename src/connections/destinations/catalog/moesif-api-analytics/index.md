title: Moesif API Analytics Destination
---

[Moesif API Analytics](https://www.moesif.com/?utm_source=segmentio&utm_medium=docs&utm_campaign=partners) helps you drive API adoption, usage, and retention. With Moesif, track your customer journey from initial ad click to first API call while identifying at-risk customers struggling to integrate with your APIs.

The [Moesif SDKs and API gateway plugins](https://www.moesif.com/implementation?utm_source=segmentio&utm_medium=docs&utm_campaign=partners) are open-source and support REST, GraphQL, and other APIs.

This destination is maintained by Moesif. For any issues with the destination, [contact the Moesif team](mailto:support@moesif.com).

## Identify

If you haven't had a chance to review our spec, please take a look to understand what the [Identify method](https://segment.com/docs/spec/identify/) does. An example call would look like:

```js
analytics.identify('userId123', {
      first_name: 'John',
      last_name: 'Doe',
      email: 'john@example.com',
      company: {
          id: '67890',
          plan: 'Free'
      }
});
```

Segment sends `identify()` calls to Moesif as [user updates](https://www.moesif.com/docs/getting-started/users/#the-update-user-endpoint?utm_source=segmentio&utm_medium=docs&utm_campaign=partners) which you can see in the _Users_ section in Moesif. If you set `traits.company.id` on the user, Moesif associates them with a company. The integration maps user fields as follows:

|Segment Field|Moesif Field|
|-------------|------------|
|`userId`|`user_id`|
|`traits`|`metadata`|
|`traits.company.id`|`company_id`|

The integration handles Segment [reserved traits](https://segment.com/docs/connections/spec/identify/#traits) like `email` and `firstName`. It maps [automatically-collected fields](/docs/connections/spec/common/#context-fields-automatically-collected) like campaign information and IP address.

## Track
If you havenâ€™t had a chance to review our spec, please take a look to understand what the [Track](https://segment.com/docs/connections/spec/track/) method does. An example call would look like:

```
analytics.track('Login Button Clicked')
```

Segment sends `track()` calls to Moesif as [user actions](https://www.moesif.com/docs/getting-started/user-actions/?utm_source=segmentio&utm_medium=docs&utm_campaign=partners) which you can see in the _Events_ section in Moesif. The integration maps event fields as follows:

|Segment Field|Moesif Field|
|-------------|------------|
|`event`|`action_name`|
|`properties`|`metadata`|
