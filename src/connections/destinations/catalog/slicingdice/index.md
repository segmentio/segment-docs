## Getting Started

{% include content/connection-modes.md %}

1. Login into your SlicingDice's Control Panel account to create a connection between SlicingDice and Segment.
2. Follow the [Connecting to Segment guide](https://docs.slicingdice.com/data_warehouse_module/connecting_external_tools/segment.html) available in SlicingDice documentation to create and allow this connection.


## Page

If you're not familiar with the Segment Specs, take a look to understand what the [Page method](https://segment.com/docs/connections/spec/page/) does. An example call would look like:

```
analytics.page()
```

Page calls will save your data in SlicingDice using the following columns:
* `{source_name}-pages-page-event`: contains the `name` attribute of the call
* `{source_name}-pages-{attribute_name}`: contains the `properties` attributes of the call, saving each one as an individual column
* `{source_name}-pages-context-{attribute_name}`: contains the `context` attributes of the call, saving each one as an individual column

## Screen

If you're not familiar with the Segment Specs, take a look to understand what the Screen method does. An example call would look like:
```
[[SEGAnalytics sharedAnalytics] screen:@"Home"];
```

Screen calls will be sent to SlicingDice using the following columns:

* `{source_name}-screens-screen-event`: contains the `name` attribute of a Screen call
* `{source_name}-screens-{attribute_name}`: contains the `properties` attributes of a Screen call, saving each one as an individual column
* `{source_name}-screens-context-{attribute_name}`: contains the `context` attributes of a Screen call, saving each one as an individual column


## Identify

If you're not familiar with the Segment Specs, take a look to understand what the [Identify method](https://segment.com/docs/connections/spec/identify/) does. An example call would look like:

```
analytics.identify('userId123', {
  email: 'john.doe@example.com'
});
```

Identify calls will be sent to SlicingDice using the following columns:
* `{source_name}-identifies-user-id`: contains the "userId" attribute of an Identify call
* `{source_name}-identifies-{attribute_name}`: contains the "traits" attributes of an Identify call, saving each one as an individual column
* `{source_name}-identifies-context-{attribute_name}`: contains the "context" attributes of an Identify call, saving each one as an individual column


## Track

If you're not familiar with the Segment Specs, take a look to understand what the [Track method](https://segment.com/docs/connections/spec/track/) does. An example call would look like:

```
analytics.track('Clicked Login Button')
```

Track calls will be sent to SlicingDice using the following columns:

* `{source_name}-track-event`: contains the "event" attribute of a Track call
* `{source_name}-track-{attribute_name}`: contains the "properties" attributes of a Track call, saving each one as an individual column
* `{source_name}-track-context-{attribute_name}`: contains the "context" attributes of a Track call, saving each one as an individual column

*Observation: if your* `context` *attribute has nested attributes, your column names will follow this pattern:* `{source_name}-track-context-{attribute_name}{nested_attribute_name}`

## Groups

If you're not familiar with the Segment Specs, take a look to understand what the [Group method](https://segment.com/docs/connections/spec/group/) does. An example call would look like:
```
analytics.group("0e8c78ea9d97a7b8185e8632", {
  name: "Initech",
  industry: "Technology",
  employees: 329,
  plan: "enterprise",
  "total billed": 830
});
```

Group calls will be sent to SlicingDice using the following columns:

* `{source_name}-groups-group-id`: contains the `groupID` attribute of a Group call
* `{source_name}-groups-{attribute_name}`: contains the `traits` attributes of a Group call, saving each one as an individual column
* `{source_name}-groups-context-{attribute_name}`: contains the "context" attributes of a Group call, saving each one as an individual column

    *Observation: Group calls will also be sent to SlicingDice using the following [Account](https://segment.com/docs/connections/storage/warehouses/schema/) columns that holds the latest state of a group.*
    * `{source_name}-accounts-group-id`: contains the `groupId` attribute of a Group call
    * `{source_name}-accounts-{attribute_name}`: contains the `traits` attributes of a Track call, saving each one as an individual column
    * `{source_name}-accounts-context-{attribute_name}`: contains the `context` attributes of a Track call, saving each one as an individual column
