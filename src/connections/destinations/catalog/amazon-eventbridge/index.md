title: Amazon EventBridge Destination
---
[Amazon EventBridge](https://aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/) is the easiest way to onboard your Segment data into the AWS ecosystem.

In addition to already supported destinations like Kinesis, S3, and Redshift, you can use EventBridge to selectively route streaming data into Amazon SQS, SNS, and any service supported by [AWS CloudWatch Events](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/events/WhatIsCloudWatchEvents.html).


## Getting Started

{% include content/connection-modes.md %}

  1. Provide Segment your AWS Account ID and the region you'd like us to configure the Segment Partner Event Source in. Ensure you've provided the same region in Segment where you'd like to configure your Event Bus.
  2. Once you send an event through with the destination enabled, we'll create a Partner Event Source in Amazon EventBridge, which you can activate in the AWS Console.
  3. Use the [AWS Console](http://console.aws.amazon.com/events/) to configure rules and destinations for the events in your Segment Partner Event Source.

The Event Source will be denoted by your Segment Source ID, which you can find in your Source Settings page under API Keys.

We'll forward all the messages in the source (pending any Destination Filters you've enabled) to the Segment Partner Event Source we create for you in EventBridge.
