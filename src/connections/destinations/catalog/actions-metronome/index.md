## Benefits of Metronome (Actions)
Metronome (Actions) provides the following benefits:

- **Streamlined Configuration**. Configure connection details on a per-event basis, rather than for the destination as a whole. 

- **Easy access to data**. The event variables picker shows you all the available data from the event you use to test the Trigger. Variables are clearly labeled to ensure they stand out from other text and markup.

- **Clear mapping of data** Actions-based destinations enable you to define the mapping between the data Segment receives from your source, and the data Segment sends to Metronome.

## Getting Started

1. From the Segment web app, click **Catalog**, then click **Destinations** 
2. Search for **Metronome** within the Destinations Catalog and select **Metronome (Actions)**
3. Click **Configure Actions Metronome**.
4. Select the source youâ€™d like to connect to and give the destination a name
5. Enter your Metronome API Token into the Segment Connection Settings UI (save changes).
