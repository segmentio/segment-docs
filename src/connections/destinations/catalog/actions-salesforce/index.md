Segment’s Salesforce (Actions) destination allows you to create, update or upsert records for any object type. Segment sends data to the [Salesforce REST API](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.api_rest.meta/api_rest/intro_rest.htm){:target="_blank"}. 

## Benefits of Salesforce (Actions) Destination vs Salesforce Destination Classic

The Salesforce (Actions) destination provides the following benefits over the classic Salesforce destination:
- **Fewer settings**. Data mapping for actions-based destinations happens during configuration, which eliminates the need for most settings.
- **Clearer mapping of data**. Actions-based destinations enable you to define the mapping between the data Segment receives from your source, and the data Segment sends to Salesforce.
- **OAuth 2.0 support**. Authentication with Salesforce uses OAuth 2.0 instead of a username/password.
- **Flexible match keys**. Upsert and update records based on any match key, including external IDs, record IDs, email and other object fields.
- **Batch support**. Reduce Salesforce overages and rate-limit errors by batching your Segment data to Salesforce's Bulk API 2.0.

## Getting started

Before you connect Segment to Salesforce, please ensure you have a Salesforce account with REST API access.

1. From the Segment web app, click **Catalog**, then click **Destinations**.
2. Search for **Salesforce** in the Destinations Catalog, and select the destination.
3. Click **Configure Salesforce** in the top-right corner of the screen.
4. Select the source that will send data to Salesforce, follow the steps to name your destination, and select **Actions** as the destination framework.
5. On the **Settings** tab, authenticate with Salesforce using OAuth.
6. Follow the steps in the Destinations Actions documentation on [Customizing mappings](/docs/connections/destinations/actions/#customizing-mappings). You must select which Event Types and/or Event Names will trigger each mapping.
7. Enable the destination and configured mappings.

## Configuration options

### Operations
When configuring a mapping, you must select the Operation that will be performed on the record. The Salesforce (Actions) destination supports the following operations:
- **Create**. Pushes new records to Salesforce. This operation is good for the following scenarios:
  - Push records into Salesforce, but don’t need data within each row to remain up to date.
  - Static data where each row is never updated, such as events.
- **Upsert**. Pushes new records to Salesforce and updates fields on existing records in Salesforce. This operation is good for the following scenarios:
  - Push records into Salesforce and keep the data up to date.
- **Update**. Updates fields on existing records in Salesforce. This operation is good for the following scenarios:
  - You have records in Salesforce that you want to add new information/fields to.
  - You want to update fields on existing records in Salesforce.
- **Delete**. Deletes existing records in Salesforce. This operation is good for the following scenarios:
  - You have records in Salesforce that you want to remove.

### Record Matchers
When using the `delete`, `update` and `upsert` operations, you must specify the match key(s) that will be used to query Salesforce for the record. You can do this within the Record Matchers object. Any field can be used as a record matcher, including:
- **External IDs**. To map an External ID, the Salesforce API name should have `__c` appended to it.
- **Record IDs**. To map a Record ID, the Salesforce API name is `Id`.
- **Standard fields**. To map a standard field, the Salesforce API name should match what is in Salesforce for the given field, for example `Email`.
- **Custom fields**. To map a custom field, the field needs to be predefined in Salesforce and the Salesforce API name should have `__c` appended to it. 

If multiple fields are provided in the Record Matchers object, Segment uses an "OR" operator to query Salesforce for a record. If multiple records are returned upon query, no updates will be made. Segment will instead record a 300 error status for the request, and the request will not be retried. **Please use fields that result in unique records**.

Please note Salesforce only allows querying on fields that have the "Filter" property. For example, Segment doesn't query on the Case `Description` because it is not a filterable property. You can lookup the standard field properties in [Salesforce’s API documentation](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.api_rest.meta/api_rest/intro_rest.htm){:target="_blank"} to determine if a field is available for querying.

## Migrate from Salesforce (Classic)

To migrate from Salesforce (Classic), complete the following steps before May 31, 2023:

1. Log in to your Segment workspace and review the copied settings in each new Salesforce (Actions) instance to ensure their accuracy. 
2. Authenticate Segment with Salesforce with OAuth.
3. Enable the Salesforce (Actions) destination & disable the Classic destination.

> info "Authenticate with Salesforce"
> Salesforce (Actions) requires OAuth based authentication while Salesforce Classic uses tokens and credentials. Because of this, Segment can't migrate authentication credentials. Your workspace owner must login and configure OAuth Authentication for each Salesforce (Actions) destinations that were migrated.

If you have more than one Salesforce instance connected to Segment, repeat these three steps for each instance. 

Keep the following in mind as you begin to use Salesforce (Actions):
- Salesforce (Actions) supports batching. The workspace owner can edit the enabled-batching field manually for any of the mappings. This setting is disabled by default.
- Sending Identify events to Salesforce (Classic) results in a create or update operation for Leads, and maps properties from `event.traits` Salesforce (Actions) does not support this behavior. By default, the automatic migration maps only a subset of the most used Lead properties as mentioned below. The workspace owner must map any additional Salesforce properties or Custom properties manually.

Review the tables below to see how settings from Salesforce (Classic) were migrated to Salesforce (Actions).

## FAQ

### How do I enable a sandbox instance?
To send data to a Salesforce sandbox instance, navigate to **Settings > Advanced Settings**, toggle on the "Sandbox Instance" setting, and authenticate. If you are already authenticated, please disconnect and reconnect with your sandbox username. 

Your Salesforce sandbox username appends the sandbox name to your Salesforce production username. For example, if a username for a production org is `user@acme.com` and the sandbox is named `test`, the username to log in to the sandbox is `user@acme.com.test`.

### How do I add custom fields?
Custom fields can be included in the Other Fields mapping. Custom fields must be predefined in your Salesforce account and should end with `__c` (for example, `My_Custom_Field__c`). Please include the `__c` in your mapping.

You can see Salesforce API names in Salesforce under **Setup > Objects and Fields > Object Manager > Select your object > Fields & Relationships > FIELD NAME**.

![the custom fields](images/image2.png)

See Salesforce's [Create Custom Fields](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?language=en_US&type=5&id=sf.adding_fields.htm){:target="_blank"} for more information on custom fields.

### How do I associate a Contact with an Account?
The only way to associate a Contact with an Account is to include the `AccountId` on the Contact record. The `AccountId` is a Salesforce-generated ID assigned to the account during creation (i.e. `0018c00002CDThnAAH`). Salesforce only accepts a single `AccountId` as the Contact’s primary account; you cannot pass an array of IDs.

> info ""
> The `AccountId` is different than the `AccountNumber` and `AccountName`. The `AccountId` is auto-generated, whereas the `AccountNumber` and `AccountName` are chosen by you.

### How do I send data for Person Accounts?
A [Person Account](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.api.meta/api/sforce_api_guidelines_personaccounts.htm){:target="_blank"} is a special type of account that represents an individual rather than a business. The requirements for Person Account records differ from what Segment’s standard Account action supports. For example, `Name` is required for Accounts, whereas `LastName` is required for Person Accounts. To send data for Person Accounts, you must use the Custom Object action. Hard code the Salesforce Object to `Account` and define other standard and custom fields, such as `LastName` and `FirstName`, in the Other Fields mapping.

![Mapping configuration for a Person account](images/custom-object_person-account.png)

Person Accounts are not enabled by default, and the solution above will only work if you have Person Accounts enabled. If you do not have Person Accounts enabled, please use the standard Account action.

### How many API calls does Segment make to Salesforce?
- For `update` and `upsert`, the query request used to determine whether the record already exists in Salesforce counts as one API call. A second API call is used to update or create that record.
- For `create`, no query is executed so one API call is used to create the record.

To check how many API calls you have left in Salesforce, go to **Setup > Company Settings > Company Information**, and you’ll find a field labeled: `API Requests, Last 24 Hours`.

### Why do I see duplicate records in Salesforce?
When using the `create` operation, it's possible for duplicate records to be created in Salesforce. This is because Segment retries records once they hit the internal timeout. It's possible Salesforce's REST API eventually processes the original record in addition to the retried record, resulting in duplicates. You may encounter this behavior if Salesforce's REST API throttles your records (for example, due to hitting API limits or complex workflow automation). To prevent duplicates, you can use [Duplicate Rules](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=duplicate_rules_map_of_reference.htm&language=en_US){:target="_blank"} in Salesforce. See set up information in [Resolve and Prevent Duplicate Data in Salesforce](https://trailhead.salesforce.com/content/learn/modules/sales_admin_duplicate_management/sales_admin_duplicate_management_unit_2){:target="_blank"}.

Please note this is only a concern when using the `create` operation. You can use the `upsert` operation instead to avoid duplicates if `upsert` meets your needs.

### How does Salesforce Bulk API work?
When **Use Salesforce Bulk API** is enabled for your mapping, events are sent to [Salesforce’s Bulk API 2.0](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.api_asynch.meta/api_asynch/asynch_api_intro.htm){:target="_blank"} rather than their streaming REST API. If enabled, Segment will collect events into batches of 1000 before sending to Salesforce. Bulk support can be used for the `upsert` or `update` operations only.

For bulk `update`, if a record in a batch is missing a Bulk Update Record ID, Segment will still send it to Salesforce. Salesforce will reject the individual record because it will be unable to find a record to update. Other records in the batch that are valid will still be processed. Please note that Segment's Event Delivery tab will show the entire batch as successful as Segment cannot currently break down Event Delivery stats into individual failed/passed events.
