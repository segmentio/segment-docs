## Migration from the classic Insider destination

If you’re already using Insider (Classic) Destination, you’re not expected to have breaking changes when upgrading to the Insider (Actions) destination. You can configure the new Actions mode destination and connect it to the same source(s) as the Classic destination and manually verify it before fully switching over.
