[PlayerZero](https://www.playerzero.app/){:target="_blank"} is an application monitoring platform 
that measures the impact of engineering issues on important product outcomes (for example: successful onboardings, checkouts, or conversions).

The Segment integration for PlayerZero automatically instruments your web application to send engineering and product analytics events to PlayerZero.

## Getting started

1. From the Segment web app, navigate to **Connections > Catalog > Destinations**.
2. Under **Categories** select **Destination Actions**.
3. Select PlayerZero Web (Actions), then click **Configure PlayerZero Web**.
4. Select an existing Source to connect to PlayerZero Web.
5. Click the toggle under **Enable Destination** to enable the destination, and click **Save Changes**.
6. PlayerZero collects data from Segment as soon as it arrives. You can set up a **View** in the PlayerZero dashboard to enable notifications and be alerted when the first high impact issue surfaces.
