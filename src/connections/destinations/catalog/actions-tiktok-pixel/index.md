[TikTok Pixel](https://ads.tiktok.com/marketing_api/docs?id=1739583652957185){:target="_blank"} is a piece of code that you can place on your website that allows you to share website events with TikTok. With TikTok for Business Tools, the Pixel can help you measure traffic on your website, measure ad campaign performance, optimize your campaigns and find new customers.

### Benefits of TikTok Pixel

Use data collected from TikTok Pixel to:
- **Build marketing audiences**: Create custom Audiences based on website visitor events, like viewing a product page or making a purchase. Audiences can be used to re-engage previous site visitors or model lookalikes to find new customers. 
- **Optimize ad delivery**: Target Audiences that are more likely to initiate a website event by setting an optimization goal on visitor events like add to cart, view page, or purchase. 
- **Measure campaign performance**: Measure your ad performance and return on ad spend (ROAS) based on a series of conversion events you define.

## Getting started with Pixel and obtaining the Pixel code

Please refer to the [TikTok Help Center documentation](https://ads.tiktok.com/help/article/get-started-pixel?redirected=2){:target="_blank"} to learn more about how to get started with TikTok Pixel. Once the Pixel is created, please retrieve the Pixel Code from TikTok Events Manager (TTEM).

## Advanced Matching

Advanced Matching helps you optimize your TikTok ads and drive performance by matching customer information with TikTok users. Hashed customer information can be shared with any TikTok event to attribute more conversions, build bigger audiences, and improve campaign optimization.

There are two types of Advanced Matching: manual or automatic.

**Manual Advanced Matching** is the passing of customer information to TikTok from your website. With this option, you have the flexibility to configure what information and for which event you want to pass to TikTok. This will be enabled automatically if PIIs are included in the Pixel events sent from TikTok Pixel Destination.

When email and/or phone number values are sent to TikTok, TikTok will try to match users with the PII you send to TikTok. If you don't send email or phone number values, TikTok will try to match users with IP and user-agent values that are included in the Pixel event payload.

**Automatic Advanced Matching** is when advertisers instruct TikTok to automatically identify form fields on pages where Pixel is installed and to hash and collect email and phone numbers entered on those pages for ad measurement and attribution purposes. Learn more about Automatic Advanced Matching and how to turn it on in [TikTok help center](https://ads.tiktok.com/help/article/advanced-matching-web?lang=en){:target="_blank"}.

To maximize Advanced Matching's performance, TikTok recommends using both Manual and Automatic Advanced Matching at the same time.

## PII hashing
- TikTok hashes all values with `sha256` before processing.

- Normalize phone numbers you send to TikTok with in the `E.164` format. This format is a combination of `+［country code]［phone number]`. For example: `+12133734253`.
