[Tiktok's Offline Events API](https://ads.tiktok.com/marketing_api/docs?id=1758049779688450) helps advertisers measure how TikTok ads result in offline customer actions, such as in-store purchases or offline subscriptions, purchases and more. Attributing online and offline events is an important step for advertisers to measure omni-channel results from their campaigns. 

**Benefits**
- **Measure how TikTok ads influence offline conversions.** Learn what online strategies lead to better Brick & Mortar sales, subscription sign-ups or leads. 
- **Power holistic attribution models with cross-channel event tracking.** Combine online and offline touchpoints to get comprehensive campaign metrics, like ROAS.
- **Reach offline customers online with custom audiences.** Promote new products or services to high-value customers who initiative offline events.


This destination is maintained by Tiktok. For any issues with the destination, [contact their Support team](mailto:segmenteng@bytedance.com).

## Acess Token & Event Set ID
Please refer to the [documentation](https://ads.tiktok.com/marketing_api/docs?id=1758051319816193) to obtain the **Access Token** and the **Event Set ID**.

## PII Requirement & Validation
TikTok Offline Events API requires at least one type of PII (email addresses and/or phone numbers) to be included in all offline conversion events. The email addresses and phone numbers will be hashed using SHA 256 from Segment before they are sent to TikTok. TikTok Offline Conversions Destination will automatically hash the provided PII, so please do not hash the PIIs before sending them to Segment. In addition, TikTok Offline Conversions Destination will validate all offline events before forwarding them to TikTok Offline Events API. TikTok Offline Conversions Destination will not send any offline events to TikTok with invalid or missing PIIs.

## Data and Privacy Considerations
- Every offline event sent to TikTok Offline Events API requires at least one email address or phone number.
- E-mails and phone numbers will be hashed in a privacy-safe way by default so that TikTok cannot identify customers who are not TikTok users.
- iOS compliance checks will be performed on PII (ATT opt-out users will still be reported and attributed).
- TikTok will pruge unmatched offline conversions IDs/records.
