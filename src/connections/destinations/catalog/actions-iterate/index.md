## Benefits of Iterate (Actions)

Iterate (Actions) provides the following benefits:

- **Simple setup** - Iterate (Actions) has a streamlined default setup process making it easier to get started in a way that "just works".
- **More control** - Actions-based destinations enable you to define the mapping between the data Segment receives from your sources, and the data Segment sends to Iterate.
- **Default property mappings** - Default mappings from the Segment like userId, userTraits, and more, allow data to be mapped correctly without any setup required.

<!-- The section below explains how to enable and configure the destination. Include any configuration steps not captured below. For example, obtaining an API key from your platform and any configuration steps required to connect to the destination. -->
