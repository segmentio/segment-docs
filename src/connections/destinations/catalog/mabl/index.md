## Page

If you haven't had a chance to review our spec, please take a look to understand what the [Page method](https://segment.com/docs/connections/spec/page/) does. An example call would look like:

```
analytics.page()
```
Page calls are used by mabl to build a model of the pages in your app and determine the number of unique users interacting with each page.  Page calls are particularly useful because they can help inform mabl's model of a page's URL patterns. You can find this information in your workspace's [coverage page](https://app.mabl.com/workspaces/-/coverage) under the "Daily Users" column.


## Track

If you haven't had a chance to review our spec, please take a look to understand what the [Track method](https://segment.com/docs/connections/spec/track/) does. An example call would look like:

```
analytics.track('Clicked Login Button')
```

Track calls are used by mabl to build a model of the pages in your app and determine the number of unique users interacting with each page. You can find this information in your workspace's [coverage page](https://app.mabl.com/workspaces/-/coverage) under the "Daily Users" column.
