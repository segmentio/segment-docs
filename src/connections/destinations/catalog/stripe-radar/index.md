## Getting Started

In order to use Stripe Radar, all you have to do is enable it in your Segment destinations page and enter your **API Key**! Read more about Stripe Radar in their [official website](https://stripe.com/radar){:target="_blank"}.

After we initialize Stripe Radar, we will call `window.Stripe.setPublishableKey(<your api key>);`.
