> **Good to know**: This page is about the [Actions-framework](/docs/connections/destinations/actions/) Heap destination. There's also a page about the [non-Actions Heap destination](/docs/connections/destinations/catalog/heap/). Both of these destinations receive data from Segment.

## Benefits of Heap (Actions) vs Heap Classic

Heap (Actions) provides the following benefits over the classic Heap destination:

- **More control with clearer mapping**. Actions-based destinations enable you to define the mapping between the data Segment receives from your source, and the data Segment sends to the destination.

- **Increased transparency**. All Segment ingested events display the Segment icon in Heap, so you can identify the source of the event, and foster greater data trust.

- **Improved setup**. Clear default settings enable you to set up faster.

## Getting started

1. From the Segment web app, navigate to **Connections** and click **Add Destination**.
2. Search for **Heap (Actions)** and click it.
3. Click **Configure Heap**.
4. Select the Source to connect to Heap (Actions).
