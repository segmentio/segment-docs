## Introduction

By turning on the LeadBoxer destination, you can start using the LeadBoxer app without adding the Lead Pixel to your website/app.

## Getting Started


Toggle Leadboxer on in your Segment destinations, and add your Dataset Identifier which you can find in the LeadBoxer interface under profile > datasets.

LeadBoxer currently supports the `identify` method for identifying leads from your online data. Other methods will be added in the near future.
