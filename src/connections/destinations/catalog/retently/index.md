## Getting Started

{% include content/connection-modes.md %}

The Retently destination allows you to send transactional surveys when an event is triggered in Segment.

It takes only three steps to set everything up and start surveying your audience:

### 1. Add Retently Destination

1. From the Destinations catalog page in the Segment App, click "Add Destination".
2. Search for "Retently" in the Destinations Catalog, and select the "Retently" destination.
3. Choose which Source should send data to the "Retently" destination.

### 2. Enter the Retently API key

1. In Retently, go to the [API token page](https://app.retently.com/settings/api/tokens).
2. Give the API key a name and click "Create".
3. Copy the API key and enter it in the "API key" section, on the Retently destination settings page.

### 3. Map survey campaign with Segment events

1. In the Retently destination settings in the Segment app, go to the **Map Retently campaigns with Segment events** section.
2. In the left input field, enter the ID of the survey campaign. [Learn how to configure the survey campaign.](https://help.retently.com/en/articles/4097690-set-up-segment-transactional-email-surveys)
3. In the right field, list the name of one or more Segment Track events that should trigger the survey in the specified campaign.
   Write the name of the event exactly as it's written in the `analytics.track` method (more details in the section below). You can enter multiple Track events by separating them with a comma symbol (for example Order Placed, Dashboard Visited).

Save your changes to activate the Retently destination. After you complete these steps, Retently sends a survey in your transactional campaign every time one of the specified Track events is triggered in Segment.


## Track

When a Segment Track event fires, Retently performs the following actions:

1. Identifies the Track event name, and attempts to match it with the campaign ID from the Retently destination settings in Segment. If no campaign ID lists this track event name, then Retently dismisses the event.
2. If the Track event name matches a campaign ID, Retently looks for the `properties` object passed with the track event, and creates a new customer record in Retently using the properties listed in the object.

The only property that Retently  **requires** is `email`. All other properties can be assigned as optional customer properties in Retently. To learn how to manage customer properties using Segment track events [see the Retently documentation](https://help.retently.com/en/articles/4097690-set-up-segment-transactional-email-surveys).

If you aren't familiar with the Segment Spec, take a look at the [Track method documentation](https://segment.com/docs/connections/spec/track/) to learn about what it does. An example call would look like:

```js
analytics.track('Subscription Activate Button Clicked', {
    email: "john.doe@example.com",
    firstName: "John",
    lastName: "Doe",
    companyName: "ACME",
    tags: "foo, bar, baz",
    subscription_name: "Professional",
    signup_date: "01/30/2020"
})
```

Segment sends Track calls to Retently as a `track` event.
