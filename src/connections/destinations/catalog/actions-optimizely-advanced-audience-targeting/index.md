## Notes 

- Ensure the Advanced Audience Targeting integration is configured in your Optimizely Products so that you can access your connected audiences from Segment Engage. 

- If connecting your Segment Engage audiences to **Optimizely Web Experimentation** ensure the user id mapped to the Optimizely User ID in the Destination mappings area is an identifier available on the browser (client side). This allows Optimizely web to properly check audience membership for visitors included in connected Segment Engage audiences.
