## Getting Started

{% include content/connection-modes.md %}

1. From the Destinations catalog page in the Segment App, click **Add Destination**.
2. Search for "Groundswell" in the Destinations Catalog, and select the Groundswell destination.
3. Choose which Source should send data to the Groundswell destination.
4. Connect Segment from the ["Integrations" page](https://app.trygroundswell.com/integrations) of the Groundswell web app, then copy the "API Key".
5. Enter the "API Key" in the Groundswell destination settings in Segment.
6. When you return to the Groundswell web app, youâ€™ll be prompted to select mappings between Segment traits and Groundswell properties. You'll be able to use these later to define workflows and send data to other tools.
    - Select whether you are identifying Companies with `Group` or `Identify` traits.
    - Provide the names of Segment traits for all required Groundswell properties for both Companies and People.
    - Add any additional mappings you wish to provide for Companies and People.
7. As Groundswell begins receiving events from Segment...
    - You'll be able to add Signals from the "Signals" page.
    - People and Companies identified by Groundswell will appear on the People and Companies pages, respectively. This is a good way to confirm your mappings are configured properly.
