## Supported methods

Variance supports the following methods of the [Segment Spec](/docs/connections/spec).

### Page

If you aren't familiar with the Segment Spec, take a look at the [Page method documentation](/docs/connections/spec/page/) to learn about what it does. An example call would look like:

```js
analytics.page()
```

Segment sends Page calls to Variance as a `Page` Event Type. 


### Screen

If you aren't familiar with the Segment Spec, take a look at the [Screen method documentation](/docs/connections/spec/screen/) to learn about what it does. An example call would look like:

```obj-c
[[SEGAnalytics sharedAnalytics] screen:@"Home"];
```

Segment sends Screen calls to Variance as a `Screen` Event Type. 


### Identify

If you aren't familiar with the Segment Spec, take a look at the [Identify method documentation](/docs/connections/spec/identify/) to learn about what it does. An example call would look like:

```js
analytics.identify('userId123', {
  email: 'john.doe@example.com'
});
```

Segment sends Identify calls to Variance as a `Contact`.


### Track

If you aren't familiar with the Segment Spec, take a look at the [Track method documentation](/docs/connections/spec/track/) to learn about what it does. An example call would look like:

```js
analytics.track('Login Button Clicked')
```

Segment sends Track calls to Variance as an `Action` Event Type.


### Group

Send [Group](/docs/connections/spec/group) to Variance. For example:

```js
analytics.group("groupId123", {
  name: "Initech",
  industry: "Technology",
  employees: 329,
  plan: "enterprise"
});
```

Segment sends Group calls to Variance as an `Account` if you've chosen the "Group" Account Mapping method during setup.

## Account Mapping

Variance offers several ways to map your users to accounts or companies, including the following.

 - **Group**: If you already use the Group call to indicate the Account, then you donâ€™t need to change anything as Segment automatically extracts the Account name.
 - **Identify with custom traits** (for example `company.id` and `company.name`): Choose this option if you include some information about the Account, Company, or Organization as a trait in each Identify call. When you choose this option, add the name of the trait you use. For example, if you configure the call with the data `{'company':{'id':1,'name':'Awesome Inc.'}}`, add `company.id` as the Account ID trait and `company.name` as the Account Name trait.
 - **Identify email trait domain extraction** (Fallback option): If you don't use the methods above, Segment extracts the domain name from the `email` trait, and uses that value as the Account name.
