> info "Wisepops Destination is device mode only (web)"

## Default Mapping

The Wisepops destination comes with [mapping presets](#available-presets). You can adjust each default mapping by going to the **Mapping** tab of the destination in the Segment web app.

### Set User Traits as Custom Properties

By default, when you identify a user, their traits are set as [custom properties](https://support.wisepops.com/article/yrdyv1tfih-set-up-custom-properties){:target='_blank'}.
A great use case is to [display the user first name in your campaign](https://support.wisepops.com/article/snksb93jrq-personalize-the-content-of-your-popup-on-the-fly){:target='_blank'}:

![User first name](images/wisepops-user-first-name.png)

> success ""
> The user ID is set as the custom property `userId`. For example, use `{{userId}}` as a hidden field value to know who responds to your Wisepops surveys.

### Set Group Traits as Custom Properties

By default, when you identify a group, its traits are set as [custom properties](https://support.wisepops.com/article/yrdyv1tfih-set-up-custom-properties){:target='_blank'} in a nested object `group`.
You must use the prefix `group.` when you refer to a group trait in Wisepops.
For example, you can [target the users of groups subscribed to your "Premium" plan](https://support.wisepops.com/article/yrdyv1tfih-set-up-custom-properties#defining-custom-conditions){:target='_blank'}:

![Group ID](images/wisepops-group-id.png)

> success ""
> The group ID is set as the custom property `group.groupId`.

### Track Event

By default, when you track an event, Segment sends a [custom event](https://support.wisepops.com/article/zbpq1z0exk-set-up-custom-events-to-trigger-popups){:target='_blank'} to Wisepops.
To show a campaign when a custom event is emitted, enter the event name as the campaign trigger.
For example, you can display a popup when a product is added to the cart:

![Event Product Added](images/wisepops-custom-event.png)

> info "Custom events count as page views in your monthly quota"
> If you track a lot of events with Segment, you may want to edit this mapping to send only the relevant events to Wisepops.

### Track Goal

By default, when you track the event **Order Completed**, Segment sends a [goal completion](https://support.wisepops.com/article/mx3z8na6yb-set-up-goal-tracking){:target='_blank'} to Wisepops.
The goal and its revenue are attached to one of your campaigns based on your Wisepops' goal attribution model.
You can easily track more goals by editing the mapping.
The goals are named after the Segment event name.

### Track Page

By default, when you track a page, Segment sends a [page view](https://support.wisepops.com/article/uymb5lywhi-wisepops-on-single-page-applications){:target='_blank'} to Wisepops.
This mapping is required for Wisepops to display campaigns at page change.
