The Ripe Segment integration is an [Actions-based Destination in cloud mode](/docs/connections/destinations/#connection-modes) that lets you send your backend events directly to Ripe.

## Getting started

> info ""
> Since this is a [cloud-mode destination](/docs/connections/destinations/#connection-modes) it will not enable Ripe features that require access to the client, for example, live calls and calendar. To use the full Ripe feature set you need to enable the device-mode [Ripe Destination](/docs/connections/destinations/catalog/actions-ripe-web/) on one of your web sources.


1. Sign in to your Segment Account
2. Open the [Ripe Cloud Mode Destination](https://app.segment.com/goto-my-workspace/destinations/catalog/actions-ripe-cloud/){:target="_blank"}.
3. Click **Configure Ripe Cloud Mode (Actions)**.
4. Select an existing Source to connect to Ripe.
5. Enter your Ripe API key in the API key field and click save.
6. Enable the Destination
