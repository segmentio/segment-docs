[Mixpanel](https://mixpanel.com/){:target='_blank'} enables you to build better products through powerful, self-serve product analytics to help you convert, engage, and retain more users.


## Benefits of Mixpanel (Actions) vs Mixpanel Classic

Mixpanel (Actions) provides the following benefits over the classic Mixpanel destination:
- **Simpler setup** - Mixpanel (Actions) has a streamlined default setup process making it easier to get started in a way that "just works".
- **More control** - Actions-based destinations enable you to define the mapping between the data Segment receives from your source, and the data Segment sends to the destination.
- **Additional default property mappings** - More default mappings from the Segment context like app name, app namespace, device type, and more.
- **Improved Groups support** - Implementation of [Segment Groups](/docs/connections/spec/group/) with [Mixpanel Group Analytics](https://help.mixpanel.com/hc/en-us/articles/360025333632-Group-Analytics){:target='_blank'} is easier. If you're already using Segment Groups, no code changes are required.

## Getting started

1. Go to your [Mixpanel project settings](https://mixpanel.com/report/settings/#account/projects){:target='_blank'}. Copy the Mixpanel API Key and API Secret for your project.
2. From the Segment web app, click **Catalog**, then click **Destinations**.
3. Find the Destinations Actions item in the left navigation, and click it.
4. Click the "Mixpanel" item to select it and click **Configure**.
5. Choose which of your sources to connect the destination to. (You can connect more sources to the destination later.)

### Connection Modes for Mixpanel (Actions) destination

The Mixpanel (Actions) destination does not offer a device-mode connection mode. If you're using one of Segment's new libraries ([Analytics.js 2.0](/docs/connections/sources/catalog/libraries/website/javascript/), [Swift](https://github.com/segmentio/analytics-swift) or [Kotlin](https://github.com/segmentio/analytics-kotlin)) with the Actions-framework version of the destination, you do not need the device-mode connection.

Once you have a mapping, you can follow the steps in the Destinations Actions documentation on [Customizing mappings](/docs/connections/destinations/actions/#customizing-mappings).

{% include components/actions-fields.html content1=group_identify_user_details section1="groupIdentifyUser" %}

<!-- MZ (1/25/2022): Once the destination is publicly available, this section will appear in the Group Identify User Details action section -->

capture group_identify_user_details

In the default configuration, Mixpanel (Actions) triggers this action when it receives a Group call.

> warning ""
> Group Analytics is available as an add-on package to customers on [Growth](https://mixpanel.com/pricing/){:target='_blank'} and [Enterprise](https://mixpanel.com/pricing/){:target='_blank'} plans.

This action sets or updates the properties of specific groups. Use this when you want to update properties on a [group profile](https://help.mixpanel.com/hc/en-us/articles/360025333632-Group-Analytics#group-profiles){:target='_blank'}.

The Groups model in Segment is slightly different than in Mixpanel. To explain the conceptual difference, it may help to think in terms of database tables. In Segment, there is a single "groups" table. You can have as many group rows as you want and each row has a unique identifier. When you want to set traits on that group, you only need to know the group id. 

However, in Segment you cannot distinguish between "types" of groups. For example, a user can belong to a "Company" as well as a "Team". There is no way to differentiate between those in Segment. In Mixpanel, you can have multiple group types which are defined by a `group key`. To update group traits in Mixpanel you need to specify the `group key` *and* `group id`.

### Default group key
By default, the Mixpanel (Actions) destination uses `$group_id` as the group key. Create a new group in Mixpanel with `$group_id` as the group key to complete the configuration. 

1. Go to your [Mixpanel project](https://mixpanel.com/report){:target='_blank'} settings
2. Scroll to the "Group Keys" section. If this section doesn't exist, you may not have the Group Analytics add-on. 
3. Create the new group key:

### Using a different group key
If you already have a group set up in Mixpanel with a different group key and wish to use that one, you can specify it in the `Group Key` field of the destination configuration.

### Backwards-compatibility with Mixpanel Classic destination
In the classic destination, the "group id" specified in the Segment SDK call was ignored and you were required to set a trait where the key of the trait is the group key and the value of that trait is the group id. While that is no longer necessary, this behavior is supported in the Mixpanel (Actions) destination to ensure backwards-compatibility. *If* you specify a trait that matches specified group key, we will use the value of that trait as the group id.

#### Scenario 1: No group key trait specified
```js
analytics.group("0e8c78ea9d97a7b8185e8632", {
  name: "Initech",
  industry: "Technology",
  employees: 329,
  plan: "enterprise",
  "total billed": 830
});
```
The group id that Mixpanel will use is `0e8c78ea9d97a7b8185e8632`.

#### Scenario 2: Group key trait IS specified
```js
analytics.group("0e8c78ea9d97a7b8185e8632", {
  $group_id: "12345",
  name: "Initech",
  industry: "Technology",
  employees: 329,
  plan: "enterprise",
  "total billed": 830
});
```
The group id that Mixpanel will use is `12345`.

## Migration from Mixpanel Classic

{% include content/ajs-upgrade.md %}

Assuming you're already using Segment Cloud-mode, the Mixpanel (Actions) destination is expected to have no breaking changes when upgrading. With the exception of a few new properties added to your events in the new Actions destination, there should be no difference in the data received in Mixpanel when using either of the Mixpanel destinations. 

If you want to confirm, you can configure the new destination to point to a different Mixpanel project and connect it to the same source(s) as the Classic destination and manually verify before fully switching over.
