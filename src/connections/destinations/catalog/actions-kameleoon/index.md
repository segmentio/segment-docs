- **Monitoring Capabilities**. Take advantage of Segment's monitoring tools to keep a vigilant eye on your operations, providing valuable insights and ensuring a seamless data flow into Kameleoon.

The integration requires that you use the same system of identifiers for both tools. While Segment uses the userId, Kameleoon uses the kameleoonVisitorCode. In order to identify which visitor triggered the forwarded Segment events, you must include the kameleoonVisitorCode inside your Segment events. To know more, see [Kameleoon's documentation on matching a Segment user with a Kameleoon visitor](https://help.kameleoon.com/setting-up-segment-destination-actions/#Matching_an_Segmentio_user_with_a_Kameleoon_visitor){:target="_blank”}.
