## Getting Started

When you toggle on Pingdom in Segment, this is what happens:

+ Our CDN is updated within 5-10 minutes. Then our snippet will start asynchronously loading Pingdom's javascript onto your page. This means you should remove Pingdom's snippet from your page if had previously put it there.
+ Pingdom will automatically start recording page load times. Go to [Pingdom](https://my.pingdom.com/rum) to view your page load performance data.

Since Pingdom only records data about page load performance, it does not collect any of the data represented by our API.
