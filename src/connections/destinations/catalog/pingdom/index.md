## Getting Started

When you enable Pingdom in the Segment web app, your changes appear in the Segment CDN in about 45 minutes, and then Analytics.js starts asynchronously loading Pingdom's JavaScript onto your page. This means you should remove Pingdom's snippet from your page if had previously put it there.
+ Pingdom will automatically start recording page load times. Go to [Pingdom](https://my.pingdom.com/rum) to view your page load performance data.

Since Pingdom only records data about page load performance, it does not collect any of the data represented by our API.
