## Getting Started

When you enable HitTail in the Segment web app, your changes appear in the Segment CDN in about 45 minutes, and then Analytics.js starts asynchronously loading `hittail.js` onto your page. This means you should remove HitTail's snippet from your page.
- HitTail will automatically start recording search keywords and showing them on its dashboard.

HitTail does not track any other forms of data, so none of the rest of our API is supported.
