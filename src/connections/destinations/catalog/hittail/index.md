title: HitTail
---

## Getting Started

When you toggle on HitTail in Segment, this is what happens:

+ Our CDN is updated within 5-10 minutes. Then our snippet will start asynchronously loading hittail.js onto your page. This means you should remove HitTail's snippet from your page.
+ HitTail will automatically start recording search keywords and showing them on its dashboard.

HitTail does not track any other forms of data, so none of the rest of our API is supported.
