## Supported methods

Spideo supports the following methods, as specified in the [Segment Spec](/docs/connections/spec).

### Track

Send [Track](/docs/connections/spec/track) calls to track user interactions, such as content watched or clicked, on your platform. For example:

```js
analytics.track('Video Content Watched',{
    asset_id: 'xyz'
});
```

`Track` events sent from Segment to Spideo will surface as different Spideo interaction types (for example 'play', 'click', 'buy'), depending on the event contents. These events will be used to personalize future user recommendations, and will feed Spideo's analytics Explore platform.
