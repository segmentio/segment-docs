> **Good to know**: This page is about the [Actions-framework](/docs/connections/destinations/actions/) Braze Segment destination. There's also a page about the [non-Actions Braze destination](/docs/connections/destinations/catalog/braze/). Both of these destinations receives data _from_ Segment. There's also the [Braze source](/docs/connections/sources/catalog/cloud-apps/braze//), which sends data _to_ Segment!

## Benefits of Braze Cloud Mode (Actions) vs Braze Classic

Braze Cloud Mode (Actions) provides the following benefit over Braze Classic:

- **E-commerce mappings**. Segment implementations that don't follow the e-commerce spec due to incompatible event names (for example, Trip Booked vs Order Completed) can use Event Triggers to log purchases in Braze Cloud Mode (Actions).

## Getting Started

1. From the Segment web app, click **Catalog**.
2. Search for "Braze" in the Catalog, select **Braze Cloud Mode (Actions)**, and choose which of your sources to connect the destination to.
3. Add the following Connection Settings:
   - **API Key**: Created under Developer Console in the Braze Dashboard.
   - **App ID**: The app identifier used to reference specific Apps in requests made to the Braze API. Created under Developer Console in the Braze Dashboard.
   - **REST Endpoint**: Your Braze REST Endpoint. For more information, see [API Overview](https://www.braze.com/docs/api/basics/){:target="_blank"} in the Braze documentation.

## Batching Data to Braze

Data sent to Braze can be batched within Cloud Mode Actions. Batch sizes are capped at 75 events, and these batches will accumulate over a 30-second period before being flushed. Request batching is done per-action mapping. For example, Identify Calls (attributes) will be batched in a request and Track Calls (custom events) will be batched in a second request. Braze recommends enabling this feature as it will reduce the number of requests being sent from Segment to Braze reducing the risk of the destination hitting Braze rate limits and retrying requests.
