[Richpanel](https://richpanel.com/?utm_source=segmentio&utm_medium=docs&utm_campaign=partners) is the helpdesk software built for Ecommerce teams to support customers at scale in a fun, easy, collaborative way.

This destination is maintained by Richpanel. For any issues with the destination, [contact the Richpanel Support team](mailto:support@richpanel.com).

## Getting Started

{% include content/connection-modes.md %}

1. From your Segment UI's Destinations page click on "Add Destination".
2. Search for "Richpanel" within the Destinations Catalog and confirm the Source you'd like to connect to.
3. If this is the first time setting up Richpanel as a destination, you’ll need to install the Segment App in your Richpanel Account.
4. In your Richpanel account, go to Data Sources > Integrations and install the Segment Connector.
5. Drop in the "API Key" into your Segment Settings UI which you can find from your [Richpanel data sources](https://app.richpanel.com/connectors/my/list).

**NOTE**: Richpanel accepts anonymous users, or [Visitors](http://event.richpanel.com/#/customers/understanding-customers), but they will not appear in the Richpanel Customer Section UI unless the customer is first identified using an `identify` call or customer actvity through Richpanel Channels, thereby becoming a [Customer](http://event.richpanel.com/#/customers/understanding-customers).

## Identify

If you're not familiar with the Segment Specs, take a look to understand what the [`identify` method](https://segment.com/docs/connections/spec/identify/) does. An example call would look like:

```js
analytics.identify('userId123', {
  email: 'john.doe@segment.com',
  richpanel_session_id: 'abc123'
});
```

`identify` calls sent to Richpanel create or update a standard customer object record. If a record with a corresponding `userId` exists, that record is updated. If no customer record exists, a new customer record is created.

The basic properties to identify and create a user are:

- `uid` : Unique User Id (required)
- `email` : User's email
- `firstName` : User's First Name
- `lastName` : User's Last Name
- `phone` : User's Phone

`uid` is a *required* field; `email`, `firstName`, and `lastName` are optional, but highly recommended.

See [Richpanel's User Properties](http://event.richpanel.com/#/properties) and [Richpanel's Events](http://event.richpanel.com/#/events?id=attribute-glossary) for more details.

## Page

If you're not familiar with the Segment Specs, take a look to understand what the [`page` method](https://segment.com/docs/connections/spec/page/) does. An example call would look like:

```js
analytics.page('Pricing', {
  title: 'Segment Pricing',
  url: 'https://segment.com/pricing',
  richpanel_session_id: 'abc123'
});
```

Page calls are sent as a tracking event to Richpanel on the timeline of the customer who was tracked. If the `richpanel_session_id` is included, it clusters this tracking event into a single “session” on the customer’s timeline.

If no `richpanel_session_id` is supplied, Richpanel will automatically generate sessionIDs based on time between tracking events. (Read why [Segment doesn’t have session tracking](https://segment.com/blog/facts-vs-stories-why-segment-has-no-sessions-api/) for more details). `page` calls can only update `email` traits, not create them.

## Track

If you're not familiar with the Segment Specs, take a look to understand what the [`track` method](https://segment.com/docs/connections/spec/track/) does. An example call would look like:

```js
analytics.track('Clicked Login Button', {
    richpanel_session_id: 'abc123'
})
```

Track calls are sent to Richpanel as a `track` event. `track` calls can only update `email` traits, but do not create them.

**NOTE**: Richpanel accepts all events listed in [Segment's Specs](https://segment.com/docs/connections/spec/ecommerce/v2/). For events like Order Updated, Order Cancelled, and Order Refunded, we recommend that you pass an `order_status` property.
