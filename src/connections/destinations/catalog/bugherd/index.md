[BugHerd](http://bugherd.com/?utm_source=segmentio&utm_medium=docs&utm_campaign=partners) is a bug tracking software that lets users report bugs right in your interface. Once reported, you get a Trello-like management interface for taking care of the issues. The `analytics.js` BugHerd Destination is open-source. You can browse the code [on GitHub](https://github.com/segment-integrations/analytics.js-integration-bugherd).

## Getting Started

{% include content/connection-modes.md %}

  1. From your Segment UI's Destinations page click on "Add Destination".
  2. Search for "BugHerd" within the Destinations Catalog and confirm the Source you'd like to connect to.
  3. Drop in your `API Key` as retrieved from the Install BugHerd tab on your BugHerd Project page.
  4. Our CDN is updated within 45 minutes. Then our snippet will start asynchronously loading BugHerd onto your page. This means you should remove BugHerd's snippet from your page.
  5. The BugHerd Destination doesn't use any Segment API calls (e.g. identify, track, etc) so, once it's loaded, it's good to go! Your BugHerd sidebar will begin appearing for your team.
