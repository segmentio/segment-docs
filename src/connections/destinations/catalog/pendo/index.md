## Getting Started

{% include content/connection-modes.md %}

1. From the Segment web app, click **Catalog**.
2. Search for "Pendo" in the Catalog, select it, and choose which of your sources to connect the destination to.
3. In the destination settings, enter your Pendo API Key which you can find in the Pendo UI under [Site Settings](https://app.pendo.io/admin) > Basic Information > API Key.

Your changes appear in the Segment CDN in about 45 minutes, and then Analytics.js starts asynchronously loading Pendo's snippet on your page and sending data.

 This pulls in all page and click events without needing to make additional method calls.

## Identify

If you're not familiar with the Segment Specs, take a look to understand what the [Identify method](https://segment.com/docs/connections/spec/identify/) does. An example call would look like:

```javascript
analytics.identify("userId1", {
  name: "Peter Gibbons",
  email: "peter@example.com",
  plan: "premium",
  logins: 5
});
```

When you send an Identify call, we will pass that user's information to Pendo with `userId` as Pendo's visitor ID. User traits that you pass are mapped to visitor metadata in Pendo.


## Group

If you're not familiar with the Segment Specs, take a look to understand what the [Group method](https://segment.com/docs/connections/spec/group/) does. An example call would look like:

```javascript
analytics.group("0e8c78ea9d97a7b8185e8632", {
  name: "Initech",
  industry: "Technology",
  employees: 329,
  plan: "enterprise"
});
```

When you send a Group call, we will send `groupId` as the Pendo as account ID. Group traits are mapped to account metadata in Pendo. If you are using Pendo account data, group calls (fields `groupId` & `traits`) are required.

## Track

If you're not familiar with the Segment Specs, take a look to understand what the [Track method](https://segment.com/docs/connections/spec/track/) does. An example call would look like:

```javascript
analytics.track("Registered", {
  groupId: "0e8c78ea9d97a7b8185e8632",
  plan: "Pro Annual",
  accountType: "Facebook"
});
```

When you send a Track call, we will send it as a Pendo Track Event. Note that `groupId` is not included by default in a Track call, but it is highly recommended to add as a property.

Pendo will map `groupId` to an account ID. For more information on Pendo's Track Events, check out their [support documentation](https://help.pendo.io/resources/support-library/integrations/track-events.html).
