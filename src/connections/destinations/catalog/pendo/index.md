## Identify

If you're not familiar with the Segment Specs, take a look to understand what the [Identify method](https://segment.com/docs/connections/spec/identify/) does. An example call would look like:

```javascript
analytics.identify("userId1", {
  name: "Peter Gibbons",
  email: "peter@example.com",
  plan: "premium",
  logins: 5
});
```

When you send an Identify call, we will pass that user's information to Pendo with `userId` as Pendo's visitor ID. User traits that you pass are mapped to visitor metadata in Pendo.


## Group

If you're not familiar with the Segment Specs, take a look to understand what the [Group method](https://segment.com/docs/connections/spec/group/) does. An example call would look like:

```javascript
analytics.group("0e8c78ea9d97a7b8185e8632", {
  name: "Initech",
  industry: "Technology",
  employees: 329,
  plan: "enterprise"
});
```

When you send a Group call, we will send `groupId` as the Pendo as account ID. Group traits are mapped to account metadata in Pendo. If you are using Pendo account data, group calls (fields `groupId` & `traits`) are required.

## Track

If you're not familiar with the Segment Specs, take a look to understand what the [Track method](https://segment.com/docs/connections/spec/track/) does. An example call would look like:

```javascript
analytics.track("Registered", {
  groupId: "0e8c78ea9d97a7b8185e8632",
  plan: "Pro Annual",
  accountType: "Facebook"
});
```

When you send a Track call, we will send it as a Pendo Track Event. Note that `groupId` is not included by default in a Track call, but it is highly recommended to add as a property.

Pendo will map `groupId` to an account ID. For more information on Pendo's Track Events, check out their [support documentation](https://help.pendo.io/resources/support-library/integrations/track-events.html).
