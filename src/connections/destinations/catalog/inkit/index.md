[Inkit](https://inkit.com){:target="_blank"} and Segment empower organizations to securely generate and distribute documents - both digitally as well as through direct mail. 
For example, automatically create and send electronic documents like invoices, reports, notices, and more through a magic link or e-delivery. Or generate and send documents for e-signature, storage, postcards, letters, and more, all powered by the Inkit integration for Segment.

For more information, see Inkit [documentation](https://docs.inkit.com/docs/welcome-to-inkit){:target="_blank"}.

## Expected Data
The merge fields in the template dictate what data you must pass to Inkit through the integration. The only must-have data point is the "template_id". 


| Field | Type | Description |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| template_id     | string     | ID of the template from the Inkit UI (required)     |


For example, you might send a letter in which you need to include the recipient's name, address, and so forth. 

## Identify

If you aren't familiar with the Segment Spec, see the [Identify method documentation](/docs/connections/spec/identify/) to learn about what it does. An example call with Inkit would look like:


> note""
> All address elements should be satisified within the segment's user identity
(exception of address_line_2 which is a custom entry)
Expected Requirements

```js
analytics.identify('userId123', {
    template_id:"<template_id>", (required)
    first_name: "Nick", (required)
    last_name: "Fury", (optional)
    address_line_1: "1 Rocket Road", (required)
    address_line_2: "Suite 1", (optional)
    address_city: "Hawthorne", (required)
    address_state: "CA", (required)
    address_zip: "90250", (required)
    address_country: "US", (required)
});
```
Call Including Address Line 2 (apt number)

```js
analytics.identify('userId123', {
    template_id:"<template_id>",
    address_line_2: "Suite 1"
});
```

Bare Minimum Call

```js
analytics.identify('userId123', {
    template_id:"<template_id>"
});
```

Custom Fields Call

```js
analytics.identify('userId123', {
    template_id:"<template_id>",
    email:"n.fury@shield.com",
    company:"SHIELD",
    phone:"3107099497",
    subscription: "premium",
    custom_field_example: "content"
});
```

All other fields are then added to the user's profile as custom fields within Inkit's dashboard.

Segment sends Identify calls to Inkit as an `identify` event.


SELECT COUNT(*) FROM destination_config WHERE destination_id = '54521fd525e721e32a72ee8f' AND enabled = 1 AND id IN (SELECT config_id FROM destination_config_options_2 WHERE option_name = 'canOmitAppsFlyerId' AND value = 'false')
