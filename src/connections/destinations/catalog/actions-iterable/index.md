[Iterable](https://www.iterable.com/?utm_source=segmentio&utm_medium=docs&utm_campaign=partners){:target="_blank”} is a cross-channel marketing platform that powers unified customer experiences and empowers you to create, optimize and measure every interaction across the entire customer journey.

This destination is maintained by Iterable. For any issues with the destination, [contact the Iterable Support team](mailto:support@iterable.com).

> success ""
> This page is about the [Actions-framework](/docs/connections/destinations/actions/) Iterable Segment destination. There's also a page about the [non-Actions Iterable destination](/docs/connections/destinations/catalog/iterable/). Both of these destinations receive data from Segment.

## Benefits of Iterable (Actions) vs Iterable Classic

Iterable (Actions) provides the following benefit over Iterable Classic:

- **Transparent data mapping**. The Classic Iterable destination receives data from Segment and converts Segment events to Iterable's format using hard coded mappings that are unable to be adjusted. The Iterable (Actions) destination allows clients to fully define their own mappings of Segment events, ensuring they receive data structured specifically for their needs.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to connect the Iterable (Actions) destination to your Segment sources:

1. Access the Segment web app and click on **Catalog**.
2. In the Catalog, use the search function to find "Iterable". Select the **Iterable (Actions)** destination from the results, and choose which of your sources to connect the destination to.


1. From the Segment web app, navigate to **Connections > Catalog > Destinations**.
2. Click the **Destination Actions** category item in the left navigation.
3. Search for **Iterable (Actions)** and select it.
4. Click **Configure Iterable (Actions)**.
5. Select an existing Source to connect to Iterable (Actions).
6. Complete the Destination Settings as listed below.

## Important differences from the classic Iterable destination

Since the release of Iterable's Classic Segment destination, Iterable has expanded its support for multiple project types. To determine the appropriate identifier for your project type, please refer to the list of available project types and their respective identifiers found at the following link: [Project Types and Unique Identifiers](https://support.iterable.com/hc/en-us/articles/9216719179796-Project-Types-and-Unique-Identifiers){:target="_blank”}.

### Creating or Updating Users

The method by which you identify users depends on the project type you use:

#### Email-based Projects
In email-based projects, it is necessary to include the email to successfully create a user in Iterable. Once both the email and `userId` have been set in Iterable, the `userId` can be utilized for any future user updates.

#### UserID-based Projects
For userID-based projects, a unique `userId` is required for creating a user in Iterable. While it is optional to add an email to a userID-based user profile, all subsequent user updates must be performed using the `userId`.

#### Hybrid Projects**
In hybrid projects, you have the flexibility to choose between using a unique email or a `userId` to create a user in Iterable.

In Iterable's previous classic destination, when making Identify calls, certain context fields were automatically mapped to user profiles. However, this behavior has been changed. Please note that the following context fields are no longer automatically mapped to Iterable user profiles during Identify calls:

- app
- device
- ip
- locale
- page
- timezone

To include these fields in user profiles, pass them as traits with Identify calls. This change offers more control and customization options for managing user data within Iterable.

Additionally, the integration has been updated to support explicit mappings for updating the `phoneNumber` user profile field, as well as support of the `mergeNestedObject` boolean field in user update calls.

### Custom Events

In UserID and Hybrid projects, when a passed ``userId`` doesn't match an existing user, Iterable creates a new user automatically. In email-based projects, tracking a custom event for an unidentified user will not create a user profile.

To ensure proper user profile creation in email-based projects:

- Call the Identify method with both a ``userId`` and an `email` to create a user profile.
- After you create the user profile, proceed with tracking the custom event for that user.

If you follow this approach, you can guarantee the creation of user profiles and accurately track custom events within Iterable for email-based projects.

### Commerce Events

In the classic destination of Iterable, cart updates were associated with Segment's `Product Added` and `Product Removed` events. However, in the Action destination, there have been updates to the default mappings. Now, custom events titled `Cart Updated` are routed to Iterable's Update Cart API.
