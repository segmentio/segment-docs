title: LinkedIn Conversion Tag Destination

## Getting Started

When you enable the LinkedIn Insight Tag in the Segment web app, your changes appear in the Segment CDN in about 45 minutes, and then Analytics.js starts asynchronously loading LinkedIn Insight Tag's tracking snippet onto your page.

This means you should remove LinkedIn Insight Tag's snippet from your page.

The LinkedIn Insight Tag automatically starts loading the pixel on sites which you load Analytics.js on.

LinkedIn Insight Tag doesn't track any other forms of data through Segment, so none of the rest of our API is supported.
