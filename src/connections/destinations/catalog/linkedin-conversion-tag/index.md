title: LinkedIn Conversion Tag Destination

## Getting Started

When you toggle on the LinkedIn Insight Tag in Segment, this is what happens:

+ The Segment CDN updates in about 45 minutes, and starts asynchronously loading LinkedIn Insight Tag's tracking snippet onto your page. This means you should remove LinkedIn Insight Tag's snippet from your page.
+ The LinkedIn Insight Tag will automatically start loading the pixel on sites which you load Analytics.js on.

LinkedIn Insight Tag doesn't track any other forms of data through Segment, so none of the rest of our API is supported.
