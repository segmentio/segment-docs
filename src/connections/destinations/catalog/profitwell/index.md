## Getting Started



1. From the Segment web app, click **Catalog**.
2. Search for "ProfitWell" in the Catalog, select it, and choose which of your sources to connect the destination to.
3. Drop your token into the Segment destination settings for "Public API Token".
You can find your public token in the [Retain control center](https://www2.profitwell.com/app/engagement) under preview snippet.
4. Select "wep app" in the dropdown if you're tracking inside the app or "marketing" for your marketing site.

## Identify

If you're not familiar with the Segment Specs, take a look to understand what the [Identify method](/docs/connections/spec/identify/) does. An example call would look like:

```javascript
analytics.identify('userId123', {
  email: 'john.doe@example.com'
});
```

Identify calls will start the ProfitWell service using the customer's email to track them. If no email is provided it will start the service anonymously.

[Customers](https://www2.profitwell.com/app/customers) need to be created first within ProfitWell in order for the indentify calls to trigger their engagements.
