## Page

If you're not familiar with the Segment Specs, take a look to understand what the [Page method](/docs/connections/spec/page/) does. An example call would look like:

```js
analytics.page()
```

Segment sends Page calls to ClearBrain as a `pageview`.


## Screen

If you're not familiar with the Segment Specs, take a look to understand what the [Screen method](/docs/connections/spec/page/) does. An example call would look like:

```objc
[[SEGAnalytics sharedAnalytics] screen:@"Home"];
```

Segment sends Screen calls to ClearBrain as a `screenview`.


## Identify

If you're not familiar with the Segment Specs, take a look to understand what the [Identify method](/docs/connections/spec/identify/) does. An example call would look like:

```js
analytics.identify('userId123', {
  email: 'john.doe@example.com'
});
```

Segment sends Identify calls to ClearBrain as an `identify` event. The `userId` becomes the primary key used to identify user attributes across later user activity events. These are then used to train and personalize your ClearBrain predictions.


## Track

If you're not familiar with the Segment Specs, take a look to understand what the [Track method](/docs/connections/spec/track/) does. An example call would look like:

```js
analytics.track('Clicked Login Button')
```

Segment sends Track calls to ClearBrain as a `track` event. You can use these to configure conversion goals to inform ClearBrain predictive analyses. You can use any Track call that has been instrumented for at least one week as the basis for a predictive goal in ClearBrain.
