This destination is maintained by Segment and is not available to customers on the free plan.

## Getting Started

The Repeater destination forwards events from a source back into another source as though that event occurred in the second source.

Events are not cached in the Repeater, so it only handles real-time events. You can specify multiple sources as Repeater destinations.

If you need to send events to a Source Function, please use the [Webhooks (Actions)](/docs/connections/destinations/catalog/actions-webhook/) destination instead. The Repeater bypasses the code of a Source Function and sends data only to the write key. The Webhook destination allows data to be sent through the Source Function code as expected.

## Configuration

Add the Repeater as a destination for the source that you want to replicate events from.

Find the source that you want events to flow to, and copy the `writeKey` from that source.

Go back to the Repeater destination's settings, and add this `writeKey` to the write keys list for Repeater.

You can do this for as many sources as you need.

Repeater sends all events it receives to the sources you specified, identified by the write key(s) you added.

## Replays with a Repeater destination

Running a Replay on a Repeater destination might count toward your MTUs, especially if you are replaying historical data from the source that flows data into your Repeater destination. 

Because the API plans count by events sent through the pipeline and the Repeater destination resends an event through the entire pipeline, one event might flow through your source twice which increases the throughput count.

Segment recommends that you notify your team before initiating a Replay if youâ€™re using a Repeater destination. 

## Repeater FAQ

##### What is the `context.repeatChain` field that I can see on my repeated events?

The `context.repeatChain` array that you will see on repeated events holds two values. The first value is the MD5-hashed write key where the event originated. The second value is the MD5-hashed write key that the event was sent to through the Repeater. This behavior lets Segment verify that the event isn't sent to a pipeline that will result in an infinite loop.
