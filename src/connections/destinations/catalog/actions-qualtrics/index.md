<!-- This template is meant for Actions-based destinations that do not have an existing Classic or non-Actions-based version. For Actions Destinations that are a new version of a classic destination, see the doc-template-update.md template. -->

<!-- Include a brief description of the destination here, along with a link to your website. -->

[Qualtrics](https://qualtrics.com){:target="_blank”} is an Experience Management platform that allows companies to design and improve customer and employee experiences through listening, analysis and action. Power richer Qualtrics insights or perform action based on your event data using the Qualtrics destination

<!-- In the section below, explain the value of this actions-based destination. If you don't have a classic version of the destination, remove this section. -->

## Benefits of Qualtrics (Actions)

Qualtrics (Actions) provides the following benefits:

- **Keeping your contact data in sync**. The Qualtrics destination provides actions to sync your contact data from your system of record up to date with Qualtrics XiD
- **Streamlined configuration**. Qualtrics destination maps your event data to the Qualtrics API & Qualtrics xflow (workflows) out of the box

<!-- The section below explains how to enable and configure the destination. Include any configuration steps not captured below. For example, obtaining an API key from your platform and any configuration steps required to connect to the destination. -->

### Limitations

To link your Qualtrics destination in Segment to your Qualtrics workspace, [Qualtrics](https://www.qualtrics.com/support/integrations/twilio-segment/twilio-segment-task/){:target="_blank"} requires a [Segment Token](https://app.segment.com/goto-my-workspace/settings/access-management/tokens){:target="_blank"} that can only be generated by Business Tier customers who have access to the [Public API](https://segment.com/docs/api/public-api/){:target="_blank"}.
