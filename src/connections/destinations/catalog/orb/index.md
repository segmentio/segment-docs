[Orb](https://www.withorb.com/) provides scalable, reliable, and flexible billing infrastructure for usage based revenue models at companies of all sizes.

Orb maintains this destination. For any issues with the destination, [contact the Orb support team](mailto:support@withorb.com).

## Getting started



1. Navigate to **Connections** and click **Add Destination** in the Segment app. 
2. Search for *Orb* in the Destinations Catalog, and select the **Orb** destination.
3. Choose which Source should send data to the Orb destination.
4. Go to the [Orb dashboard](https://app.billwithorb.com) and create a new API key from the configuration page.  Segment recommends you to create a new API key for this integration rather than using an existing one.
5. Enter the **API Key** in the Orb destination settings in Segment.
6. Enter the connection settings for the external customer ID and properties mapping fields.

## Supported methods

Orb currently supports track calls, as specified in the [Segment Spec](/docs/connections/spec).

### Track

Use [Track](/docs/connections/spec/track) calls to automatically send usage events based on your customer's interactions with your application. Any Segment track call will be ingested through [Orb's ingestion pipeline](https://docs.withorb.com/docs/orb-docs/event-ingestion) and usage information will be used to calculate billable totals. For example:
```js
analytics.track({
  event: "payment_confirmed",
  userId: "external_customer_id",
  properties: {
    amount: 100.00,
    currency: "USD",
    confirmation_time: "2022-05-11T21:33:13.1652304793Z"
  }
});
```
Similar to Segment, Orb supports a flexible event schema in the `properties` dictionary, which should be non-null and not contain nested objects. Within Orb, you can configure metrics by filtering and aggregating events. When you configure the Orb destination, you are required to specify a mapping of keys from the original Segment event to Orb’s usage event. You can also configure keys corresponding to Orb’s required fields such as `event_name` , `idempotency_key`, and `external_customer_id`. 

Events ingested through the track spec are available on the Orb admin dashboard, specifically on the [Events page](https://app.billwithorb.com/events).
