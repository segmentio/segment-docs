## Supported methods

ProsperStack supports the following methods, as specified in the [Segment Spec](/docs/connections/spec).

### Identify

Send [Identify](/docs/connections/spec/identify) calls to ProsperStack to update subscriber custom properties in ProsperStack. For example:

```js
analytics.identify("userId123", {
  email: "john.doe@example.com",
  traits: {
    "Number of contacts": 5800,
    "Is professional": true,
    "Last contacted": "2021-05-04",
    "Preferred name": "Johnny",
  },
});
```

Segment sends Identify calls to ProsperStack as an `identify` event.

Custom traits specified in an Identify call update [custom properties](https://prosperstack.com/docs/custom-properties/){:target="\_blank"} for a corresponding subscriber in ProsperStack. You must specify an `email` in an Identify call in order for a ProsperStack subscriber to match with the Identify call. 

Custom properties in ProsperStack that match the exact key of a trait update automatically. You can configure additional trait mappings in the [ProsperStack configuration dashboard](https://app.prosperstack.com/settings/integrations/segment){:target="\_blank"}.
