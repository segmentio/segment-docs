### How it works
MadKudu receives your customer data from Segment, enriches it, and updates your CRM profiles.

The enriched CRM profiles solves 2 problems for your sales reps:

+ Reduces wasted time on unqualified leads.
+ Prevents reps from missing high-value leads.

### MadKudu's solution

Unlike traditional lead scoring solutions, MadKudu requires no manual effort or guesswork. MadKudu uses rigorous statistical methods based on data science to identify the most qualified leads based on customer demographics.

Additionally, MadKudu uses a customer's in-app behavior to detect sales opportunities such as closing, churn, or upsell.
