Twilio Messaging gives businesses a way to reach customers on SMS, MMS, and WhatsApp for transactional notifications and personalized campaigns.

The Twilio Messaging destination connects Segment to Twilio, so teams can send messages automatically based on real-time events, audience segments, or journeys without managing complex integrations.

With the Twilio Messaging destination, you can:

- Confirm orders or appointments
- Send shipping updates or reminders
- Deliver personalized marketing messages
- Support onboarding and reactivation campaigns

This destination supports two ways to send messages:

- **Content templates**: Messages pre-built and managed in Twilio.
- **Inline messages**: Messages created directly in Segment, with dynamic fields and variables.

Twilio Messaging integrates tightly with Segment's data and audience tools, so you can deliver timely, personalized messages without building custom integrations.
