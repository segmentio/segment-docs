## Additional information

### Supported messaging channels
You can send messages using SMS, MMS, WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger channels. 

### Supported Content Template types
Segment supports these Twilio Content Template types: Text, Media, Quick reply, Call to action, List picker, Card, WhatsApp card, WhatsApp Authentication and Catalog.

### Inline messages
You can send messages without referencing a Twilio Content Template. In this case the message body, Media URLs, and variables can be defined directly in Mapping fields. Segment then constructs the final message body by combining the provided body and variables before sending it through Twilio.

1. Select **Inline** from the *Content Template Type* mapping field. 
2. Provide the message body in **Inline Template**. You can include variables using Handlebars notation. For example, `{{first_name}}`.
3. Provide Media URLs in **Inline Media URLs**. 
4. Define variables using the **Inline Variables**. Make sure to define variables for every variable included in the message body. 

### Can templates be defined or edited in Segment?
Segment does not have a Content Template Builder capability. Content Templates must be built in Twilio first, then referenced in Segment. Alternatively, the 'Inline message' option can be used (see above). 

### Sender details
Three types of Sender types are supported: 
1. Phone Number - An E.164 formatted phone number. Check the Twilio Console to ensure that the selected number supports the selected Channel type. 
2. Messenger Sender ID - This is supported only when the **Facebook Messenger** channel type is selected.
3. Twilio Messaging Service - This is supported for all channels. 

### Variables
Variables can be used in both Content Templates and for inline messages and can be included in the message body as well as Media URLs. Variables referenced when using Content Templates must be pre-defined in Twilio.
