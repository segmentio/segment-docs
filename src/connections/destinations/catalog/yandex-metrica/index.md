[Yandex.Metrica](https://metrica.yandex.com/about?utm_source=segmentio&utm_medium=docs&utm_campaign=partners) enables customizable report analytics so marketers can toggle between attribution models, segment and compare audiences based on custom details like OS, number of visits, and ad blocker usage. It also supports session replay, heat maps, form analytics so marketers can review user movements such as mouseclicks, form fill ins, and keystrokes. Finally, it supports custom events tracking and purchase funnels, and automates eCommerce reports to calculate metrics like cost per order and total costs.

Our Yandex.Metrica destination code is open sourced on GitHub. Feel free to check it out here for [JavaScript](https://github.com/segment-integrations/analytics.js-integration-yandex-metrica).

## Getting Started

1. From the Segment web app, click **Catalog**.
2. Search for "Yandex.Metrica" in the Catalog, select it, and choose which of your sources to connect the destination to.
3. Enter your Counter ID that you can find in your Yandex.Metrica UI navigating to Settings > Tag.

Your changes appear in the Segment CDN in about 45 minutes, and then Analytics.js starts asynchronously loading Yandex.Metrica's snippet on your page and sending data.

Once you've followed these steps you should be good to go! No additional code is required for your Yandex.Metrica Destination to start tracking activity on your page.
