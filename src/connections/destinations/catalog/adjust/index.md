title: Adjust Destination
---

[Adjust](https://adjust.com) is the mobile attribution provider of choice for hundreds of organizations across the globe. They unify all your marketing activities into one powerful platform, giving you the insights you need to scale your business. The Adjust Destination is open-source. You can browse the code on GitHub for [iOS](https://github.com/segment-integrations/analytics-ios-integration-adjust) and [Android](https://github.com/segment-integrations/analytics-android-integration-adjust).

## Getting Started

{% include content/connection-modes.md %}

1. From your Segment UI's Destinations page click on "Add Destination".
2. Search for "Adjust" within the Destinations Catalog and confirm the Source you'd like to connect to.
3. Do not need to include Adjust's SDK natively as this prevent you from successfully implementing the Adjust.
4. Depending on the source you've selected, include Adjust's library by adding the following lines to your dependency configuration.

### iOS

If you are using iOS, simply add this line to your [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org) `Podfile`:

```ruby
pod "Segment-Adjust"
```

After adding the dependency, you must register the destination with our SDK.  To do this, import the Adjust destination in your `AppDelegate`:

```objective-c
#import <Segment-Adjust/SEGAdjustIntegrationFactory.h>
```

And add the following lines:

```objective-c
NSString *const SEGMENT_WRITE_KEY = @" ... ";
SEGAnalyticsConfiguration *config = [SEGAnalyticsConfiguration configurationWithWriteKey:SEGMENT_WRITE_KEY];

[config use:[SEGAdjustIntegrationFactory instance]];

[SEGAnalytics setupWithConfiguration:config];

```

In cases where the Adjust integration sometimes does not track the install attribution properly, you can configure a delay for the Adjust reporting to ensure all session parameters have been loaded properly. Segment allows you to configure this via our UI by enabling `setDelay` and providing a `delayTime` in seconds. Segment then calls the [Adjust iOS SDK's configuration](https://github.com/adjust/ios_sdk#delay-start) to set a delay. The maximum delay start time of the Adjust SDK is 10 seconds.


### Android

If you are using Android, simply add this line to your gradle file:

```java
compile 'com.segment.analytics.android.integrations:adjust:+'

```

After adding the dependency, you must register the destination with our SDK.  To do this, import the Adjust destination:

```java
import com.segment.analytics.android.integrations.adjust.AdjustIntegration;

```

And add the following line:

```javascript
analytics = new Analytics.Builder(this, "write_key")
                .use(AdjustIntegration.FACTORY)
                .build();
```

After you build and release to the App Store, we'll automatically start translating and sending your data to Adjust.

### Server

Our Cloud-mode integration allows you to send *supplemental* data to Adjust.  This, however, *does not* include attribution events. If you are relying on the Adjust server-side component, and you are not bundling the Segment-Adjust SDK, your installs will not be attributed. E-commerce events and other general `track` events are supported out of the box. You **must** map your `track` events to your custom Adjust Event Token in your [Adjust destination settings](#map-your-events-to-custom-adjust-event-tokens).

Additionally, to send any events to Adjust from the server, you must include the `device.id` as well as the `device.type` in the context object of your event. For example:

```javascript
analytics.track({
  userId: '019mr8mf4r',
  event: 'Item Purchased',
  properties: {
    revenue: 39.95,
    shippingMethod: '2-day'
  },
  context: {
    device: {
      id: '3e9ffbefafe0d903',
      type: 'Android'
    }
  }
});
```

## Identify

If you haven't had a chance to review our spec, please take a look to understand what the [Identify method](https://segment.com/docs/connections/spec/identify/) does. An example call would look like:

```javascript
analytics.identify('12091906-01011992', {
  name: 'Grace Hopper',
  email: 'grace@usnavy.gov'
});
```

When you call `identify`, Segment will call Adjust's [addSessionPartnerParameter](https://github.com/adjust/ios_sdk#session-partner-parameters) method and set the `userId` and/or `anonymousId`. This will set these values within Adjust, and allow Adjust to send back attribution data from their servers.


## Track

If you haven't had a chance to review our spec, please take a look to understand what the [Track method](https://segment.com/docs/connections/spec/track/) does. An example call would look like:

```javascript
analytics.track('Article Completed', {
  title: 'How to Create a Tracking Plan',
  course: 'Intro to Analytics',
});
```

When you call `track` Segment maps the event to your pre-defined Adjust custom event. You **must** map your `track` events to your custom Adjust Event Token in your Adjust destination settings.

If you don't provide a mapping, Adjust cannot accept the event. We include all the event `properties` as callback parameters on the Adjust event, and automatically translate `revenue` and `currency` to the appropriate Adjust event properties based on our [spec'd properties](/docs/connections/spec/track/#properties).


## Reset

If you haven't had a chance to review our spec, please take a look to understand what the [Reset method](https://segment.com/docs/connections/spec/reset/) does. An example call would look like:

```javascript
analytics.reset();
```

When you call `reset`, Segment will reset these partner parameters via Adjust's [resetSessionPartnerParameters](https://github.com/adjust/ios_sdk#session-partner-parameters) method.

## Install Attributed

### Client

Segment will trigger an `Install Attributed` event if you have **trackAttributionData** enabled in your settings, and the Segment-Adjust integration installed in your app.

Using Adjust's [Attribution callback](https://github.com/adjust/ios_sdk#attribution-callback), Segment listens for an attribution change from Adjust's SDK and triggers the call with the following Adjust attribution parameters:

| Key  | Value  | Description |
|--:|---|---|
|  provider | Adjust  | hardcoded by Segment |
| trackerToken | attribution.trackerToken | the tracker token of the current install |
| trackerName | attribution.trackerName | the tracker name of the current install |
| campaign.source |  attribution.network | the network grouping level of the current install |
| campaign.name | attribution.campaign | the campaign grouping level of the current install |
| campaign.content | attribution.clickLabel | the ad group grouping level of the current install |
| campaign.adCreative | attribution.creative | the creative grouping level of the current install |
| campaign.adGroup | attribution.adgroup | the click label of the current install |

If any value is unavailable, it will default to nil.  This call will be sent to all enabled [device and cloud mode](https://segment.com/docs/connections/destinations/#connection-modes) destinations.

#### Troubleshooting

If you are also loading Adjust's SDK natively in addition to loading via the Segment-Adjust integration, `Install Attributed` event callback will likely be affected/unable to be triggered. **Remove native Adjust implementation**.

Since there will not be a change in attribution for registered testing devices you are currently using to send data to Adjust, you will need to unregister that device in Adjust.

To do so:
1. Take note of the IDFA/advertisingId (you can find this in the raw view of an event in your Segment debugger)
2. Uninstall the app from your device
3. Delete the `IDFA`/`advertisingId` from [Adjust's testing console](https://docs.adjust.com/en/testing-console/)
4. Re-install the app on the device and you should now see the device register in Adjust and an `Install Attributed` triggered.

### Server

Unlike the Device-mode option to send `Install Attributed` to Segment, the Cloud-mode option will not include device context information nor will it be sent to enabled device mode destinations.

If you are bundling the Segment-Adjust integration and would like attribution data sent from Adjust's servers back to Segment, you can [enable Segment as a Special Partner in Adjust](https://docs.adjust.com/en/special-partners/segment/#sending-partner-parameters-to-segment). Once set up, Install Attributed will be sent to Segment, and on to enabled Cloud-mode destinations.

Please reach out to the Adjust team at `support@adjust.com` for questions related to enabling Segment as a Adjust Special Partner.


## Additional Features

### Environments

By default, our destination sends data to the Adjust Sandbox Environment. When you release your app to the App Store, enable the `Production` option in the Adjust destination settings on Segment (or use two separate sources, one for dev and one for prod, with different environment settings for Adjust).

### Callback Parameters

The destination sends all event `properties` as callback parameters to Adjust. To set [Partner Parameters](https://github.com/adjust/ios_sdk#partner-parameters), you can [access the Adjust SDK directly](https://docs.adjust.com/en/special-partners/segment/).

**Note** that we now support setting these Partner Parameters. Be sure you are pulling in the minimum versions for [iOS 1.1.0](https://github.com/segment-integrations/analytics-ios-integration-adjust/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#version-110-6th-july-2017) and [Android 0.3.0](https://github.com/segment-integrations/analytics-android-integration-adjust/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#version-030-6th-july-2017).

### Transaction Deduplication

The destination will automatically recognize the spec'd `orderId` property, and send it as the transaction ID to Adjust for revenue de-duplication.

### Duplicate Purchase Events

If you're using Adjust's iOS SDK, it will automatically takes care of duplicate purchase events. We use Adjust's default deduplication (using `transactionId`) when you send an `orderId` (see the [ecommerce spec](/docs/connections/spec/ecommerce/v2/#order-completed)).

### In-App Purchase Receipts

The destination does not currently support in-app purchase receipts. If this is important to you, please [let us know](/contact/).

### Push Notifications

The destination automatically forwards push notification tokens through to Adjust.

### Event Buffering

By default, our destination enables event buffering for Adjust. This saves your customers' battery life. However, you can disable this in the options on the Adjust destination settings on Segment.

### Deep Linking

The destination does not automatically support deep linking out of the box (you'd need to write code here regardless). This means you can use [Adjust's deep-linking](https://github.com/adjust/ios_sdk#7-set-up-deep-link-reattributions) by accessing [the Adjust SDK directly](/docs/connections/sources/catalog/libraries/mobile/ios/#faq).
