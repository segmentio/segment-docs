[Amazon Kinesis](https://aws.amazon.com/kinesis/) enables you to build custom applications that process or analyze streaming data for specialized needs. Amazon Kinesis Streams can continuously capture and store terabytes of data per hour from hundreds of thousands of sources such as website clickstreams, financial transactions, social media feeds, IT logs, and location-tracking events.


## Getting Started

{% include content/connection-modes.md %}

To get started:
1. Create a Kinesis stream. Follow these [instructions](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/streams/latest/dev/learning-kinesis-module-one-create-stream.html){:target="_blank"} in order to create a new AWS Kinesis Stream.
   * A stream is composed of multiple shards, each of which provides a fixed unit of capacity. The total capacity of the stream is the sum of the capacities of its shards. Each shard corresponds to 1 MB/s of write capacity and 2 MB/s of read capacity. See the [Amazon Kinesis Developer Guide](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/streams/latest/dev/introduction.html){:target="_blank"} for more information on estimating number of shards needed for your stream.
2. Create an IAM policy.
   1. Sign in to the [Identity and Access Management (IAM) console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/){:target="_blank"}.
   2. Follow these instructions to [Create an IAM policy](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_create.html){:target="_blank"} to allow Segment permission to write to your Kinesis Stream.
   3. Select the **Create Policy from JSON** option and use the following template policy in the `Policy Document` field. Be sure to change the `{region}`, `{account-id}` and `{stream-name}` with the applicable values.

       ```json
       {
          "Version": "2012-10-17",
          "Statement": [
              {
                  "Effect": "Allow",
                  "Action": [
                      "kinesis:PutRecord",
                      "kinesis:PutRecords",
                      "iam:SimulatePrincipalPolicy"
                  ],
                  "Resource": [
                      "arn:aws:kinesis:{region}:{account-id}:stream/{stream-name}",
                      "arn:aws:iam::{account-id}:role/{role-name}"
                  ]
              }
          ]
       }
       ```

    * **NOTE:** A previous version of this policy document only granted `PutRecord` access, which could slow down Kinesis write times by disallowing file batching. Substitute the updated policy document above to grant Kinesis `PutRecords` (plural) and allow batching. We've also requested `iam:SimulatePrincipalPolicy`, which will allow us to verify that the IAM Role has the appropriate Kinesis permissions without invoking the Kinesis API.

3. Create an IAM role.
   1. Follow these instructions to [Create an IAM role](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_create_for-user.html#roles-creatingrole-user-console){:target="_blank"} to allow Segment permission to write to your Kinesis Stream.
   2. When prompted to enter an Account ID, enter `595280932656`. Make sure to enable **Require External ID** and enter your Segment Source ID as the External ID. This can be found by navigating to **Settings > API Keys** from your Segment source homepage.
   * **NOTE:** If you have multiple sources using Kinesis, enter one of their source IDs here for now and then follow the procedure outlined in the [Multiple Sources](/docs/connections/destinations/catalog/amazon-kinesis/#multiple-sources) section once you've completed this step and saved your IAM role.
   3. When adding permissions to your new role, find the policy you created in step 2 and attach it.

4. Create a new Kinesis destination.
   1. In the Segment source that you want to connect to your Kinesis destination, click **Add Destination**. Search and select the **Amazon Kinesis** destination.
   2. Enter the **Role Address**, **Stream Region**, **Stream Name**, and **Secret ID**.
   * **NOTE:** For security purposes, Segment sets your Workspace ID as your Secret ID. If youâ€™re using a Secret ID different from your Workspace ID, reach out to our support team so they can change it to make your account more secure.

## Page
If you're not familiar with the Segment Specs, take a look to understand what the [Page method](/docs/connections/spec/page/) does. An example call would look like:

```js
  analytics.page();
```

## Identify
If you're not familiar with the Segment Specs, take a look to understand what the [Identify method](/docs/connections/spec/identify/) does.  An example call would look like:

```js
analytics.identify('97980cfea0085', {
  email: 'gibbons@example.com',
  name: 'John Gibbons'
});
```

## Track
If you're not familiar with the Segment Specs, take a look to understand what the [Track method](/docs/connections/spec/track/) does. An example call would look like:

```js
analytics.track("User Registered", {
  checkinDate: new Date(),
  myCoolProperty: "foobar",
});
```

### Data Model
Let's say you're connecting your Segment customer data stream to Kinesis Stream `arn:aws:kinesis:{region}:{account-id}:stream/{stream-name}`. If you send Segment the following in a `track` call:
```json
{
  "userId": "user_1",
  "event": "User Registered",
  "properties": {
    "plan": "Pro Annual",
    "account_type" : "Facebook"
  }
}
```

The Segment Kinesis destination issues a `PutRecord` request with the following parameters:
```js
kinesis.putRecord({
  Data: new Buffer(JSON.stringify(msg)).toString('base64')
  PartitionKey: msg.userId() || msg.anonymousId(),
  StreamName: 'stream-name'
});
```

Segment uses the the `userId || anonymousId` as the `PartitionKey`. The partition key is used by Amazon Kinesis to distribute data across shards. Amazon Kinesis segregates the data records that belong to a stream into multiple shards, using the partition key associated with each data record to determine which shard a given data record belongs to.

> note ""
> **NOTE:** The JSON payload is base64 stringified.

## Group
If you're not familiar with the Segment Specs, take a look to understand what the [Group method](/docs/connections/spec/group/) does.

An example group call is shown below:
```js
analytics.group("0e8c78ea9d9dsasahjg", {
  name: "group_name",
  employees: 3,
  plan: "enterprise",
  industry: "Technology"
});
```

## Troubleshooting
When you get started, Segment recommends using any of the open source [Kinesis tailing utility](https://github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=kinesis-tail){:target="_blank"} to validate that data is flowing correctly.

## Best Practices

### Updating IAM role permissions for encryption
Extra permissions need to be added to the IAM role if using at-rest encryption on the Kinesis stream. An updated role policy like below resolves issues when submitting PutRecords into Kinesis stream using encryption:

```json
{
	"Version": "2012-10-17",
	"Statement": [{
		"Effect": "Allow",
		"Action": ["kms:GenerateDataKey"],
		"Resource": "${aws_kms_key.kinesis_key.arn}"
	}, {
		"Effect": "Allow",
		"Action": ["kinesis:PutRecord", "kinesis:PutRecords"],
		"Resource": ["${aws_kinesis_stream.kinesis1.arn}"]
	}]
}
```

### Multiple Sources
If you have multiple sources using Kinesis/Firehose, you have two options:

### Attach multiple sources to your IAM role
To attach multiple sources to your IAM role:
1. Find the IAM role you created for this destination in the AWS Console in **Services > IAM > Roles**.
2. Select the role and navigate to the **Trust Relationships** tab.
3. Click **Edit trust relationship**. You'll see a snippet that looks something that looks like this:

    ```json
    {
      "Version": "2012-10-17",
      "Statement": [
        {
          "Effect": "Allow",
          "Principal": {
            "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::595280932656:root"
          },
          "Action": "sts:AssumeRole",
          "Condition": {
            "StringEquals": {
              "sts:ExternalId": "YOUR_SEGMENT_SOURCE_ID"
            }
          }
        }
      ]
    }
    ```
4. Replace that snippet with the following, and replace the contents of the array with all of your source IDs.
    ```json
    {
      "Version": "2012-10-17",
      "Statement": [
        {
          "Effect": "Allow",
          "Principal": {
            "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::595280932656:root"
          },
          "Action": "sts:AssumeRole",
          "Condition": {
            "StringEquals": {
              "sts:ExternalId": ["YOUR_SEGMENT_SOURCE_ID", "ANOTHER_SOURCE_ID", "A_THIRD_SOURCE_ID"]
            }
          }
        }
      ]
    }
    ```

### Update IAM to Support PutRecords

The Kinesis destination defaults to use PutRecords. A previous version of the IAM policy document only grants `PutRecord` access, which slows down Kinesis write times and degrades data deliverability. Substitute the updated policy document above to grant Kinesis `PutRecords` (plural) and allow batching, like this:
   ```json
   {
      "Version": "2012-10-17",
      "Statement": [
          {
              "Effect": "Allow",
              "Action": [
                  "kinesis:PutRecord",
                  "kinesis:PutRecords",
                  "iam:SimulatePrincipalPolicy"
              ],
              "Resource": [
                  "arn:aws:kinesis:{region}:{account-id}:stream/{stream-name}",
                  "arn:aws:iam::{account-id}:role/{role-name}"
              ]
          }
      ]
   }
   ```
After you update the IAM policy, Segment systems default to use PutRecords for more efficient data transmission. This is a zero-downtime change and doesn't impact your data other than increasing the deliverability success rate.

### Use secret ID
If you have many sources using Kinesis that it's impractical to attach all of their IDs to your IAM role, you can instead opt to set a secret ID. To set this value:
1. Go to **Connections > Destinations > Amazon Kinesis** for each of your Segment sources.
2. Click **Secret ID**.
    * **NOTE:** For security purposes, Segment sets your Workspace ID as your Secret ID. If youâ€™re using a Secret ID different from your Workspace ID, reach out to our support team so they can change it and make your account more secure.
3. Find the IAM role you created for this destination in the AWS Console in **Services > IAM > Roles**.
4. Click on the role and navigate to the **Trust Relationships** tab.
5. Click **Edit trust relationship**. You should see a snippet that looks something that looks like this:

    ```json
    {
      "Version": "2012-10-17",
      "Statement": [
        {
          "Effect": "Allow",
          "Principal": {
            "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::595280932656:root"
          },
          "Action": "sts:AssumeRole",
          "Condition": {
            "StringEquals": {
              "sts:ExternalId": "YOUR_SEGMENT_SOURCE_ID"
            }
          }
        }
      ]
    }
    ```
6. Replace the value of `sts:ExternalId` (`"YOUR_SEGMENT_SOURCE_ID"`) with your Secret ID. In the case of requiring the use of multiple secretIds, replace the `sts:ExternalId` setting above with:

   ```
    "sts:ExternalId": ["A_SECRET_ID", "ANOTHER_SECRET_ID"]
   ```
