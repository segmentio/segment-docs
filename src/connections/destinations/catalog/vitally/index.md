5. Once Vitally receives at least one event from Segment, you'll be able to proceed with the set up process and configure how to [create accounts from Segment](https://docs.vitally.io/managing-the-customer-lifecycle/account-hierarchy-using-vitallys-organization-object/supported-integrations-and-how-to-create-the-hierarchy#segment){:target="_blank"}

## Identify

If you haven't had a chance to review the spec, take a look to understand what the [Identify method](/docs/connections/spec/identify/) does. An example call would look like:

```
analytics.identify('userId123', {
  name: 'John Doe',
  email: 'john.doe@yourcustomer.com',
  avatar: 'https://yourdomain.com/avatars/johndoe.png',
  role: 'CEO'
});
```

Identify calls are used by Vitally to maintain a picture of a single user. The traits you pass to the Identify call will be displayed on the user's dashboard and can be used for sorting and filtering users within an account and across all of your users.

Passing along the following traits will correspond to what is displayed in Vitally:
  * `name` is used to set the name of the user in Vitally
  * `email` sets the user's email in Vitally
  * `avatar` is used to display an avatar for the user

## Track

If you haven't had a chance to review the spec, take a look to understand what the [Track method](/docs/connections/spec/track/) does. An example call would look like:

```
analytics.track('enabled-slack-integration', {
   channel: '#support'
})
```

Track calls are used in Vitally to track and analyze your accounts' engagement with your product. Vitally provides out-of-the box analysis on your events, plus the ability to define your own custom metrics on top of those events, like [Success Metrics](https://docs.vitally.io/account-health-scores-and-metrics/success-metrics){:target="_blank"} and [Elements](https://docs.vitally.io/account-health-scores-and-metrics/elements).


## Group

If you haven't had a chance to review the spec, take a look to understand what the [Group method](/docs/connections/spec/group/) does. An example call would look like:

```js
analytics.group("accountId123", {
  name: "Initech",
  industry: "Technology",
  plan: "enterprise",
  mrr: 2000
});
```

Group calls are used by Vitally to maintain a picture of an account. Any traits you pass to the Group call are added to the account in Vitally and can be used to analyze your customer base as a whole. You can view a customer's traits on their dashboard, use them for sorting and filtering, configure rules to automate your customer success process, and even create segments) of your accounts.

Passing along the following traits will correspond to what is displayed in Vitally:
  * `name` is used to set the name of the account in Vitally
