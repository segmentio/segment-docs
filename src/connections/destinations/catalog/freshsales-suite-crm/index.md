## Supported methods

Freshsales Suite - CRM supports the following methods.


### Identify

You can use identify to create a contact when a website visitor fills a webform. When you identify a user, Segment passes that user’s information to Freshsales.


#### UserId

userId is a mandatory field which is used to identify the contact in Freshsales. If your user identifier is not email, then email has to be a part of traits.

```json=
{
  "userId": "97980cfea0067",
  "type": "identify",
  "traits": {
    "firstName": "John",
    "lastName": "Doe",
    "email": "john.doe@example.com",
    "cfAlternateNumber": "98765432",
    "company": {
      "name": "Example.com"
    }
  }
}

```

#### Traits

Traits are pieces of information you know about a user that are included in an identify method.

#### Default Traits

Segment reserved some traits that have semantic meanings for users. You should only use reserved traits for their intended meaning. Check the [Segment Spec](/docs/connections/spec/identify/#traits) to get a list of reserved traits.


All attributes that are a part of traits should correspond to the internal names of those fields in Freshsales. Segment ignores attributes that aren't mapped with their corresponding fields. 

However, Segment makes an exception for two attributes: `title` and `phone`, which are reserved traits in Segment. They automatically map to the Freshsales attributes of `job_title` and `work_number` respectively.

#### Custom Traits

As part of traits, you can send custom fields created in Freshsales by using their internal names in camel case. You can find internal names in the corresponding field settings page. 

Custom fields won't automatically create. You have to create them in Freshsales before proceeding to send data from Segment. [Learn more](https://crmsupport.freshworks.com/en/support/solutions/articles/50000002389-how-to-create-custom-fields-for-contacts-accounts-and-deals-){:target="_blank"} about creating custom fields in Freshsales.

#### Objects

You can also update Accounts and Deals associated with a contact in Freshsales. The company and deal objects in the identify payload correspond to the Accounts and Deals objects in Freshsales. When you use the identify method to create a contact, it's possible to also create the corresponding Account and Deal and Freshsales. To do this, pass the company or the deal objects within traits in the identify call.

```json=
{
  "userId" : "97980cfea0067",
  "type": "identify",
  "traits" : {
    "firstName": "John",
    "lastName": "Doe",
    "email": "john.doe@example.com",
    "company": {
      "name": "Example.com"
    },
    "deal" :{
      "name" : "Sample Deal",
      "amount": 1234
    }
  }
}
```

### Track

You can track activities of your website visitors. If a user is subscribing to a newsletter and you want to track it, use the track method.

```json=
{
  "userId" : "john.doe@example.com",
  "event": "Email Bounced",
  "type": "track",
  "properties" : {
    "emailId": "110688",
    "emailSubject": "Welcome to Example.com",
    "campaignId": "123",
    "campaignName": "New Customer Discount"
  }
}
```

Segment standardized a series of reserved event names that have special semantic meaning. Segment maps these events to tools that support them whenever possible. See the [Semantic Events docs](/docs/connections/spec/semantic) for more detail. Custom events are supported as well.

### Page

If you want to track users visiting your sites, you can use the page method. When you call a page event, Segment sends a pageview to Freshsales. You can send extra data parameters within properties in the event payload. [See the reserved properties for more details](/docs/connections/spec/page/#properties).

```json=
{
  "userId" : "john.doe@example.com",
  "name": "Page view",
  “type”: ”page”, 
  "properties" : {
    "title": "Welcome to pricing page | Example.com",
    "url" : "http://example.com/pricing"
  }
```

### Custom Fields Aren't Updating
