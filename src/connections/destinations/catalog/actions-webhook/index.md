Segment's Webhooks (Actions) destination uses internet protocol and HTTP callback to submit real-time user data to your own HTTP endpoints. With this destination, you can POST, PUT, or PATCH data to any webhook URL.

> info ""
> The Webhooks (Actions) destination is in beta and is in active development. Some functionality may change before it becomes generally available.

## Getting Started

1. From the Segment web app, navigate to **Connections > Catalog**.
2. Search for **Webhooks (Actions)** in the Destinations Catalog, and select the destination.
3. Click **Configure Webhooks (Actions)**.
4. Select the source that will send data to Webhooks (Actions) and follow the steps to name your destination.
5. If you require authentication, add in a shared secret on the **Settings** > **Advanced Settings** tab. If you provide a shared secret, Segment will sign requests with an HMAC in the "X-Signature" request header. The HMAC is a hex-encoded SHA1 hash generated using the shared secret and the request body.
6. Follow the steps in the Destinations Actions documentation on [Customizing mappings](/docs/connections/destinations/actions/#customize-mappings). You can create up to 5 mappings, each of which can send to a different webhook URL.
7. Enable the destination and configured mappings.
