title: UserIQ Destination
---

[UserIQ](http://useriq.com) empowers companies to deliver what each user needs to be successful in every moment, starting with adoption. Our platform collects user engagement data from your product and allows you to communicate to your users when they are most engaged: within the product itself.

This destination is maintained by UserIQ. For any issues with the destination, please [reach out to their team](mailto:support@useriq.com).

_**NOTE:** The UserIQ Destination is currently in beta, which means that they are still actively developing the destination. This doc was last updated on March 0, 2019. If you are interested in joining their beta program or have any feedback to help improve the UserIQ Destination and its documentation, please [let  their team know](mailto:support@useriq.com)!_
