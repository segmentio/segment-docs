## Supported Methods

Rokt supports the `track` API call, which can be used to send data to Rokt:


### Track
The `track` API call is how you record any actions your users perform, along with any properties that describe the action. [Learn more about the track call](/docs/connections/spec/track/). 
An example call would look like:
```js
analytics.track('Clicked Login Button', , {
    property1: 1,
    property2: 'test',
    property3: true
})
```

Segment sends `track` calls to Rokt as `track` events. You can use these to configure conversion goals to inform the destnation predictive analyses. You can use any `track` call made in the past week as the basis for a predictive goal in the Rokt destination.
