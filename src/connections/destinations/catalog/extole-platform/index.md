## Identify

If you haven't had a chance to review our spec, please take a look to understand what the [Identify method](https://segment.com/docs/connections/spec/identify/) does. Identify calls are sent to Extole as an `identify` event.
Segment sends Identify calls to Extole as an `identify` event. Extole creates a new profile or updates an existing one. The table below lists how the basic traits are mapped:

| Segment Traits | Extole Properties |
| -------------- | ----------------- |
| `userId`       | `partner_user_id` |
| `email`        | `email`           |
| `firstName`    | `first_name`      |
| `lastName`     | `last_name`       |

> info ""
> **Note:** All non-standard traits will be added to Extole user profile as PUBLIC parameters.

An example of `.identify()` call:

```js
analytics.identify('userId123', {
  email: 'john.doe@example.com',
  firstName: 'John',
  lastName: 'Doe',
  age: 25,
  existingCustomer: true
});
```


## Track

If you haven't had a chance to review our spec, please take a look to understand what the [Track method](https://segment.com/docs/connections/spec/track/) does. An example call would look like:

```js
analytics.track('Login Button Clicked')
```

Track calls are sent to Extole as a `track` event.

### Track Registrations

Track when a user creates a new account. The example below shows a track event with an event name of  `registration`.

```js
analytics.track('registration', {
    email: 'john.doe@example.com',
    first_name: 'John',
    last_name: 'Doe',
    partner_user_id: 'userId123'
})
```
Extole recommends that you send the `partner_user_id` with every call. If an event is fired multiple times for the same user, Extole de-duplicates it.




### Track Conversions

Track when a user performs a purchase.

```js
analytics.track('conversion', {
    email: 'john.doe@example.com',
    first_name: 'John',
    last_name: 'Doe',
    partner_conversion_id: 'purchaseId123',
    cart_value: '99.99'
})
```

Extole recommends that you send the `partner_conversion_id` with every call. If an event is fired multiple times for the same user, Extole de-duplicates it.


## Event Names

If you do not use the event names `registration` and `conversion` in your implementation, contact [Extole Support](mailto:support@extole.com) and Extole can re-map these events to any other event names.


## Delete

To make consumer data deletion requests more seamless, Extole handles deletion requests.

Example of expected `delete` request body:
```json=
{
    "userId": "056tf9eqw24"
}
```

Upon receiving a deletion request, Extole removes all data associated with that user.
