## Data Tracking

Sherlock's system processes data for all tracking calls with the following notes.

### Page and Screen

When Sherlock receives `page` calls, they record a `Viewed Page` event. Sherlock sets a `Viewed Page: Page Name` property on it with the `name` from the page call.

Similarly when Sherlock receives a `screen` call, they record a `Viewed Screen` event with a `Viewed Screen: Screen Name` property.

### Group

When Sherlock receives a `group` call, they record all traits specified for the group. They also assign a `Group ID` trait to to the user indicating membership.

### Alias

When they receive an `alias` call, they record an alias for the specified `userId` and `previousId`. Data under both names are then merged into a single record.

### Nested Objects and Arrays

Sherlock's system flattens nested property and trait values into key/value pairs. Consider an object:

```javascript
{
  "id": 42,
  "item": {
    "name": "Hat",
    "details": {
      "color": "red",
      "size": "small"
    }
  }
}
```

This would be flattened into pairs with keys for each path delimited by `.`:

```javascript
{
  "id": 42,
  "item.name": "Hat",
  "item.details.color": "red",
  "item.details.size": "small"
}
```

Array values are unsupported and ignored by Sherlock's system.
