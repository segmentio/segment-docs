[Uservoice](https://www.uservoice.com/) is a customer support and feedback tool that lets your users submit feedback right from your site, and helps you manage all the incoming requests.

This document was last updated on November 8th, 2018. If you notice any gaps, out-dated information or simply want to leave some feedback to help us improve our documentation, please [let us know](https://segment.com/help/contact)!

## Getting Started

{% include content/connection-modes.md %}

1. From your Segment UI's Destinations page click on "Add Destination".
2. Search for "UserVoice" within the Destinations Catalog and confirm the Source you'd like to connect to.
3. Add your Javascript API Key (Your API Key appears in the javascript snippet URL as widget.uservoice.com/APIKEY.js.) and enable the destination in Segment.
4. We'll automatically start recording data.

When UserVoice is enabled in Segment, our CDN will update within 45 minutes, and Uservoice's javascript is asynchronously loaded onto your page. Please remember to remove UserVoice's snippet from your page.

## Identify


If you haven't had a chance to review our spec, please take a look to understand what the [Identify method](https://segment.com/docs/spec/identify/) does. An example call would look like:

```
analytics.identify('ze8rt1u89', {
  name: 'Zaphod Beeblebrox',
  gender: 'Male',
  email: 'Zaphod@hotmail.com',
  phone: '1-401-826-4421',
  address: {
    city: 'San Francisco',
    state: 'Ca',
    postalCode: '94107'
  }
});
```

When you call `identify` the `userId` and `traits` included in the call will be set to the current user in UserVoice. For more details on identifying users on UserVoice, please check [their documentation](https://developer.uservoice.com/docs/widgets/identify/).

## Group

If you haven't had a chance to review our spec, please take a look to understand what the [Group method](https://segment.com/docs/spec/group/) does. An example call would look like:

```
analytics.group("0e8c78ea9d97a7b8185e8632", {
  name: "Initech",
  industry: "Technology",
  employees: 329,
  plan: "enterprise",
  "total billed": 830
});
```

When you call `group` the `traits` included in the call will be set to the current user's **Account** in UserVoice. For more details on grouping users on UserVoice, please check [their documentation](https://developer.uservoice.com/docs/widgets/identify/).

## Alias

If you haven't had a chance to review our spec, please take a look to understand what the [Alias method](https://segment.com/docs/spec/alias/) does. An example call would look like:

```
analytics.alias("507f191e81");
```
For your implementation, make sure to replace "507f191e81" with your user's previous ID.

Calling `alias` connects anonymous visitors to identified users.
