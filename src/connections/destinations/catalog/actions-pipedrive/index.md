The Actions Pipedrive destination is an integration that allows customers to share events from Segment directly to Pipedrive. When you use Pipedrive with Segment, you don’t need to manually export and upload data to Pipedrive. Your customer data will remain up to date in real time and across all enabled integrations. Every tool you use to interact with leads and customers will land in Pipedrive, so you can always have a clear picture in front of you.

## Benefits of Actions Pipedrive

Actions Pipedrive provides the following benefits:

- **Clear mapping of data**.  Actions-based destinations enable you to define the mapping between the data Segment receives from your source and the data Segment sends to Pipedrive.
- **Maximum event measurement**. Capture more events with improved accuracy across different browsers, apps, and devices to get a unified view of your customer’s journey from page view to purchase.

## Getting started

1. From the Segment web app, click **Catalog**, then click **Destinations**.
2. Find the Destinations Actions item in the left navigation, and click it.
3. Click **Configure "Actions Pipedrive"**.
4. Select an existing Source to connect to "Actions Pipedrive".
5. When adding Pipedrive as a destination, you will be redirected to the basic settings page, where you need to enter the destination name as well as Pipedrive's domain and API token.
6. To complete the installation process, switch to advanced settings and enter your Pipedrive IDs.

To set up the Segment integration with your Pipedrive account:
1. Go to either your Marketplace menu within your settings or directly to Pipedrive's Marketplace.
