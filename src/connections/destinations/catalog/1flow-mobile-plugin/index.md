## Getting started

2. Click **Add Destination**.
4. Select an existing Source to connect to 1Flow Mobile Plugin.
5. Go to 1flow.ai -> Settings -> Project Settings, copy the 1Flow project key, and paste it into the Destination Settings in Segment.
6. Depending on the mobile source youâ€™ve selected, include 1Flow's library by adding the following lines to your dependency configuration.

## iOS

### Step 1: Add Segment1Flow Package using Swift Package Manager

In the Xcode File menu, click Add Packages. You'll see a dialog where you can search for Swift packages. In the search field, enter the URL to this repo.

- `https://github.com/1Flow-Inc/segment-1flow-ios`

You'll then have the option to pin to a version, or specific branch, as well as which project in your workspace to add it to. Once you've made your selections, click the Add Package button.

### Step 2: Initialize Segment and add 1Fow Destination

```
import Segment1Flow
...
let config = Configuration(writeKey: "YOUR_WRITE_KEY_HERE")
let analytics = Analytics(configuration: config)
analytics.add(plugin: OneFlowDestination())
```

## Android

### Step 1: Install Segment1Flow Package

- If gradle version is 6.5 or lower, include the below repository in your project's build.gradle file:

```
allprojects{
    repositories{
        google()
        jcenter()
        maven{url 'https://jitpack.io'} 
    }
}
```

- If gradle version is higher than 6.5, add the below code in settings.gradle.

```
dependencyResolutionManagement {
    repositoriesMode.set(RepositoriesMode.FAIL_ON_PROJECT_REPOS)
    repositories {
        google()
        mavenCentral()
        maven{url 'https://jitpack.io'}
    }
}
```

- Add dependency in your app's build.gradle file:

```
compileSdkVersion 34
....
defaultConfig {
              ....
              minSdkVersion 21
    }
dependencies {
        ....
        
    implementation 'com.segment.analytics.android:analytics:4.11.3'
    implementation "com.github.1Flow-Inc:segment-1flow-android:2023.09.26"
}
```

### Step 2: Initialize Segment and add 1Flow Destination
```
Analytics analytics = new Analytics.Builder(context, "YOUR_WRITE_KEY_HERE")
    .use(OneFlowIntegration.FACTORY)
    ...
   .build();
    ...
    Analytics.setSingletonInstance(analytics);

```

## Supported methods

### Identify
If you're not familiar with the Segment Specs, take a look to understand what the [Identify method](/docs/connections/spec/identify/) does. An example call would look like:

```swift
analytics.identify(userId: "peter@example.com", traits: [
    "name": "Peter Gibbons",
    "email": "peter@example.com",
    "mobile": 1234567890
])
```
When you call identify method of segment, it will be equivalent to `logUser` of 1Flow. `userId` will be `userID` and `traits` will be `userDetails`.

### Track
If you're not familiar with the Segment Specs, take a look to understand what the [Track method](/docs/connections/spec/track/) does. An example call would look like:

```swift
analytics.track(name: "ButtonClicked")
```
Any value passed in `name`, will be eventName and if you have passed any event property, then it will be event `parameters`.

### Screen

Send [Screen](/docs/connections/spec/screen) calls to record which mobile app screens users have viewed. For example:

```swift
analytics.screen(title: "Home")
```

Segment sends Screen calls to 1Flow as a `screen_[name]` event (or `screen_view` if a screen name isn't provided).
