Koala enables you to identify website visitors with ease so you can turn traffic into actionable leads. See which companies are researching your docs, checking out your pricing page, and showing intent to buy.

Segment is the easiest way to install Koala. If you've already got Segment running on your website, we recommend this approach. With Segment, you can instrument Koala easily without code.

Koala maintains this destination. For any issues with the destination, [contact the Koala Support team](mailto:support@getkoala.com).

## Getting Started

1. From the Segment web app, navigate to **Connections > Catalog > Destinations**.
2. Search for “Koala” and select "Add Destination".
4. Select the web source that will send data to Koala and follow the steps to name your destination. The web source chosen must use [Analytics.js 2.0](/docs/connections/sources/catalog/libraries/website/javascript/).
5. On the **Settings** tab, input your “Public API Key” which can be found in your Koala workspace settings under **Settings > Install**.
6. Once connected, you can configure how you want to send data to Koala. By default, Segment will forward track events and identify events to Koala. We recommend sticking with the defaults!
