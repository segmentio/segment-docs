## Getting Started

{% include content/connection-modes.md %}

Currently, this destination supports events originating from Mobile sources alone.

You can read more about how to define a source [here](/docs/connections/sources/#what-is-a-source).

To get started with Adikteev and Segment, you'll need an account with Adikteev.

If you don't have an account with Adikteev and want to use our services together with Segment contact us here: [contact@adikteev.com](mailto:contact@adikteev.com).

## Track

Adikteev is built to understand and analyze all the events generated by your app. For us to receive and analyze the events correctly, make sure you use the right [Track](/docs/connections/spec/track/) events as specified by Segment's Spec.
