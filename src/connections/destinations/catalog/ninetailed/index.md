## Identify

If you aren't familiar with the Segment Spec, take a look at the [Identify method documentation](/docs/connections/spec/identify/) to learn about what it does. An example call would look like:

```js
analytics.identify('userId123', {
  email: 'john.doe@example.com'
});
```

Segment sends Identify calls to Ninetailed as an `identify` event. 

Use Identify calls to associate traits with a user with which can be used for personalization in email campaigns or website components.

analytics.track('Login Button Clicked')
```

Segment sends Track calls to Ninetailed as a `track` event.
