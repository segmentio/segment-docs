## Supported methods

Inflection supports the following methods, as specified in the [Segment Spec](/docs/connections/spec).

### Identify

Send [Identify](/docs/connections/spec/identify) calls to Identify a user. The traits should have the `email` trait to be processed. All the other reserved traits are optional, but will be used to populate *Person DB* if available.
If a *Data Warehouse* is set to sync *Person DB* data to Inflection, the Identify call will be used only to map the `userId` to the `person.id` on Inflection app.
For example:

```js
analytics.identify('userId123', {
  email: 'john.doe@example.com'
});
```


### Track

Send [Track](/docs/connections/spec/track) calls to be added to *Product Activity* on Inflection App. For example:

```js
analytics.track('Login Button Clicked')
```

### Group

Send [Group](/docs/connections/spec/group) calls to tie a user to an org. There are two IDs that are relevant in a group call: the userId, which belongs and refers to the user, and the groupId, which belongs and refers to the specific group.  A user can belong to multiple groups, each associated with a different groupId, but the user will have only one userId linked to each of these different groups.

```js
 analytics.group("0e8c78ea9d97a7b8185e8632", {
name: "Initech",
industry: "Technology",
employees: 329,
plan: "enterprise",
"total billed": 830
});
```
