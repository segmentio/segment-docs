[Watchtower](https://www.watchtower.ai/?utm_source=segmentio&utm_medium=docs&utm_campaign=partners) is a platform to discover, classify, and protect sensitive data, like customer PII, across cloud services & data infrastructure. This enables you to identify sensitive data that you're ingesting and sending to various business-critical systems -- so you can manage the customer data you're disseminating across services.

This destination is maintained by Watchtower. For any issues with the destination, [contact the Watchtower Support team](mailto:support@watchtower.ai).
