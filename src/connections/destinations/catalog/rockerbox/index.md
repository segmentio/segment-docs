## Getting Started

All you need in order to integrate with Rockerbox is your pixel code, which you can get by emailing **info@rockerbox.com**.

## Page

When you trigger a `.page()` call, we will fire `window.RB.track('view')` and pass your page properties, including any custom properties outside of url, path, title, etc.

## Track

Rockerbox can accept any custom `.track()` events and properties.
