## Getting Started

To integrate with Rockerbox, you need a pixel code. To request one, contact [Rockerbox](info@rockerbox.com){:target="_blank"}.

## Page

Triggering a Page call fires `window.RB.track('view')` and passes on page properties, including any custom properties outside of `url`, `path`, `title`.

## Track

Rockerbox can accept any custom `.track()` events and properties.
