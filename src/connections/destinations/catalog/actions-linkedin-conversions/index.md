The LinkedIn Conversions API (CAPI) is a conversion tracking tool that creates a direct connection between marketing data from an advertiser’s server and LinkedIn. This integration enables advertisers to measure the performance of their LinkedIn marketing campaigns no matter where the conversion happens and use this data to power campaign optimization. The Conversions API can help strengthen performance and decrease cost per action with more complete attribution, improved reliability, and optimized delivery.

### Set up a mapping to Stream Conversion Events

Follow the steps in the Destination Actions documentation on [Customizing mappings](/docs/connections/destinations/actions/#customize-mappings). You must create 1 mapping for every conversion rule. After you create a conversion rule, you cannot update the connected LinkedIn Ad account.  

1. On the Mappings tab, click on **+ New Mapping** and Select **Stream Conversion Event**. 
2. Select the events you'd like to map and send to your LinkedIn Conversions API destination.
3. Create a conversion rule or enter the link to an existing rule. _If you chose to create a new conversion rule, Segment creates the conversion rule as soon as you click **Save**._  
4. Configure the mappings to map event fields and user attributes from your source to the Conversion API. 
5. Click **Save**. 

After you've created a Stream Conversion Event mapping, Segment displays the connected rule for each mapping on the Mappings tab. To update the conversion rule you created, select the menu icon for the mapping you'd like to update and click **Edit Mapping**. Scroll to section 3, Create a Conversion Rule, and select **Edit your configuration**. After making changes to your conversion rule, click **Save** to save your changes. You can make changes to all fields except for the Ad account field. After you save your changes, Segment updates the conversion rule in LinkedIn.
