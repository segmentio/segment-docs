## Supported methods

Flagship.io supports the following methods as specified in the [Segment Spec](/docs/connections/spec).

### Identify

Send [Identify](/docs/connections/spec/identify) calls to the Flagship.io webhook. For example:

```js
analytics.identify('userId123', {
  email: 'john.doe@example.com',
  trait1: 1,
  trait2: "test",
  trait3: true
  },    
});
```

Segment sends Identify calls to Flagship.io as an `identify` event. The Flagship.io data engine then ingests the different traits associated to the identified user.

The received traits are available in the [Flagship use case builder](https://docs.developers.flagship.io/docs/getting-started-with-flagship#4-create-your-first-campaign-on-the-platform){:target="_blank"}.


### Group

Send [Group](/docs/connections/spec/group) calls to Flagship.io webhook. The Flagship.io data engine then ingests the different traits associated to the identified group. For example:

```js
analytics.group("0e8c78ea9d97a7b8185e8632", {
  name: "Initech",
  industry: "Technology",
  employees: 329,
  plan: "enterprise",
  "total billed": 830
});
```

Segment sends Track calls to Flagship.io as a `group` event. The Flagship.io data engine then ingests the different traits associated to the identified user.

The received traits are available in the [Flagship use case builder](https://docs.developers.flagship.io/docs/getting-started-with-flagship#4-create-your-first-campaign-on-the-platform){:target="_blank"}.
