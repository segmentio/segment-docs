## Benefits of Voucherify (Actions) vs Voucherify (Classic)

New destination type allows any changes in mapping of fields from an event, more customization, adding filters to events.
Thanks to the integration, your brands can quickly transfer customer data from Segment to Voucherify and the other way around. Now, the development team doesnâ€™t have to create a separate app for customer data synchronisation, as it comes out of the box with this integration. Other benefits include:
Accurate customer data at your fingertips. 
Portable data and greater flexibility with data transfers. 
Use of systems that are interoperable and support each other rather than compete. 

From now you are able to choose who is eligible for the discount, what products should be in the cart, when they should receive the offer, via which channel, when and where customers can use it and how many times. Then, you want to learn who has redeemed the promotion, whether the incentive worked out, how it influenced the shopping decision and how it impacted the global CAC and CLV rates.
