## Getting Started

You'll need to map from the Segment event name to the Millennial Media Pixel ID in your Segment source's Millennial Media Destination page.

### Getting your Pixel ID

We built this destination off [this documentation](http://docs.millennialmedia.com/conversion-tracking/S2S/mobile-web.html) refer to that or let us know if you have any questions!
