Intercom is a customer communications platform that shows you who is using your product. Intercom allows you to personally communicate with your users with targeted content, behavior-driven messages, and conversational support.

When you use the Intercom Web (Actions) destination, Segment loads the [Intercom JavaScript library](https://developers.intercom.com/installing-intercom/docs/intercom-for-web){:target="_blank"} for you. The Intercom library enables you to track your userâ€™s events on your website and interact with the Intercom messenger window.

## Benefits of Intercom Web Mode (Actions) vs Intercom Classic
Intercom Web (Actions) provides the following benefits over the classic Intercom destination:

- **Fewer settings.** Data mapping for actions-based destinations happens during configuration, which eliminates the need for most settings.
- **Clearer mapping of data.** Actions-based destinations enable you to define the mapping between the data Segment receives from your source, and the data Segment sends to the destination.
- **Granular control over data sent.** You can customize the conditions under which the events are sent to Intercom.
- **Selectively shows the Intercom chat widget.**

## Getting Started

1. From the Segment web app, navigate to **Connections > Catalog**.
2. Search for **Intercom Web (Actions)** in the Destinations Catalog, and select the destination.
3. Click **Configure Intercom Web (Actions)**.
4. Select the web source that will send data to Intercom Web (Actions) and follow the steps to name your destination. The web source chosen must use [Analytics.js 2.0](/docs/connections/sources/catalog/libraries/website/javascript/).
5. On the **Settings** tab, input your Intercom App ID and other destination settings.
6. Follow the steps in the Destinations Actions documentation on [Customizing mappings](/docs/connections/destinations/actions/#customizing-mappings).
7. Enable the destination and configured mappings.
