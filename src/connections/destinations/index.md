## Sources vs Destinations

Segment has [Sources](/docs/sources/) and [Destinations](/docs/destinations/). [Sources](/docs/sources/) send data _into_ Segment, while [Destinations](/docs/destinations/) receive data _from_ Segment.

## Source Compatibility

Segment has four types of sources: Web, Mobile, Server, and Cloud App. Our web source is [analytics.js](/docs/sources/website/analytics.js/), an example of a mobile source would be [analytics-ios](/docs/sources/mobile/ios/), an example of a server source would be [analytics-node](/docs/sources/server/node/), and an example of a cloud app source would be our [Stripe source](/docs/sources/cloud-apps/stripe/).

Different destinations might only be compatible with specific source types. Many destinations are compatible with all four types of sources, but some are only compatible with a few types (for example, web only, or server only). To find out which types of sources a specific destination is compatible with, check the "Supported Sources and Connection Modes" section of that destination's documentation page.

## Connection Modes

Segment's native client-side libraries (analytics.js, iOS, and Android) have the ability to pull in client-side dependendencies for *Device-based Connection Modes* with our destination partners.

When you choose to use a *Device-based Connection Mode*, Segment includes some additional mapping logic which pulls the third-party library for your destination into the browser or our SDK. We then translate your tracking events into the native API format that the tool expects, and send the data directly from the user’s device to the destination’s servers. This may be optional or required to ensure full functionality of the tool and a few other factors explained below.

In contrast, when you use *Cloud-based Connection Modes*, Segment forwards data to the destination directly via our servers, saving you from incurring the additional size and method count of the destination's mobile SDK or web library.

### Why do some destinations offer or require Device-based Connection Modes?

There are two primary factors that dictate whether we build and support Device-based or Cloud-based Connection Modes (or both!) for a given destination partner.

**Cross-domain and Cross-application Anonymous Attribution**

*Mobile*:
On mobile, even anonymous identifiers are generally persistent. This allows us to build Cloud-based destinations as the default. Using native advertising identifiers, our partners are able to reconcile a user who, for example, viewed an advertisement in one app and installed another app as a result, regardless of their SDK being present on the device.

Some partners do more advanced reconciliation based on additional factors, and will require their SDK be packaged on the device as a result. For those destinations, we'll offer a Device-based Connection Mode.

*Web*:
On web, cross domain identity resolution — a critical component of attribution modeling — requires the attribution tool to employ a third party cookie for tracking a user anonymously across domains. Since, as a matter of principle, Segment only uses first party cookies and does not sync our cookies with any partners, analytics.js and the data it collects itself is insufficient for view-through attribution with ad networks.

We allow our customers to take advantage of advertising and attribution tools by loading their respective libraries and pixels in the context of the browser and triggering Deviced-based requests to that provider in response to Segment API calls.

**Client-native Destination Functionality**

On both mobile and web, it's common for our partners to offer client-side functionality in their SDKs and libraries that extend beyond the primary use case of data collection. In these cases, we offer Device-based Connection Modes so that you can still completely abstract over the *implementation* of their SDK and ensure that all the data you collect with Segment is still routed appropriately, while availing you of their complete native functionality.

Some features that would require a Device-based Connection Mode include automatic A/B testing; displaying user surveys, live chat or in-app notifications; touch/hover heatmapping; and accessing rich data such as CPU usage, network data, or raised exceptions.

### Choosing a Connection Mode

Cloud-based Connection Modes are the default on mobile (where you can simply elect not to package the third-party SDK and our Cloud-based destination will forward data instead). On web, we have a few destinations currently in beta with a Cloud-based Connection Modes to help improve your site performance.

Before you turn on or opt for this mode, consider if the destination you’re using has some features that require device-based interactions (see the examples above). For example, if you use the Cloud-based Connection Mode for Mixpanel, you won’t be able to use their features for in-app surveys or auto-tracking, which can be really valuable! But you’ll get your data in their reporting and people features just fine.

### How do I tell which Connection Modes and Platforms are supported for an Destination?

The first place to look is the individual destination doc. Each one will have a matrix of supported Sources and Connection Modes.

In order to override the default, check the destination settings pane in the app either for a **Connection Mode** toggle or instructions on bundling any additional mobile components required.

## Data Deliverability

Segment increases deliverability to destinations in two ways: retries and replays. Retries happen automatically for all customers, while replays are available on request for [Business](https://segment.com/pricing) customers.

### Retries

**Retries in our Client Libraries**

Our client libraries ensure delivery of your data to our API reliably in the face of spotty connections, device failure, or network partitions in your data centers.

When you use our mobile SDK, we dispatch each event to a background thread where the event is then written to a queue. Later, our SDK batches together many requests in to one compressed request and sends it to our servers. Our SDKs minimize battery use and bandwidth use by powering up the radio less frequently and for shorter time periods.

If the delivery of the payload is not successfully sent due to connection issues, all of our SDKs will automatically retry the request until successful receipt of the payload according to the following policies. Please note that retry policies are subject to change / tuning in the future.

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Platform</th>
    <th title="Sleep duration before the first retry">Initial Wait</th>
    <th title="Rate of growth of the sleep duration between each retry">Wait Growth</th>
    <th title="Maximum sleep duration between retries">Max Wait</th>
    <th title="Maximum number of individual retries">Max Attempts</th>

**Mobile Library Retries**

All mobile libraries handle retries by periodically attempting to flush their internal queue of events to Segment. If the flush is unsuccessful, the library will wait until the next regularly-scheduled flush time to try again. The background queue of requests to Segment is bounded in size so if events are being queued faster than we can successfully flush them to Segment, some events may be dropped.

**Retries between Segment and Destinations**

The destination endpoint APIs we send data to have fluctuations in availability due to any number of issues ranging from network failures to bugs to overload. Segment's internal systems retry failed destination API calls for 4 hours with a randomize exponential backoff after each attempt. This substantially improves delivery rates.

Here's an example destination that was only successfully accepting 93.36% of all API requests but was achieving a 99.28% final deliverability rate due to Segment's retry functionality.

![Segment destination data deliverability retries](images/integration-data-deliverability.png)

You can see the current destination endpoint API success rates and final delivery rates for Segment's server-side destinations on our [status page](https://status.segment.com).

### Replays

Replays allow customers to replay historical data from our S3 logs into downstream server-side destinations. If you want to try out a new email or analytics tool, for example, we can replay your historical data for the past 6 months into that tool. This gives you a great testing environment and prevents data lock-in when vendors try to hold data hostage. Replay is available to our [Business](https://segment.com/pricing) customers, and you can learn more by [contacting us](https://segment.com/contact/sales).

## Warehouse Schemas

The table below describes the schema in Segment Warehouses:

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>`<source>.aliases`</td>
    <td>A table with all of your `alias` method calls. This table will include all of the `traits` you identify users by as top-level columns, for example `<source>.aliases.email`.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>`<source>.groups`</td>
    <td>A table with all of your `group` method calls. This table will include all of the `traits` you record for groups as top-level columns, for example `<source>.groups.employee_count`.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>`<source>.accounts`</td>
    <td>*CURRENTLY IN BETA* A table with unique `group` method calls. Group calls are upserted into this table (updated if an existing entry exists, appended otherwise). This table holds the latest state of a group.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>`<source>.identifies`</td>
    <td>A table with all of your `identify` method calls. This table will include all of the `traits` you identify users by as top-level columns, for example `<source>.identifies.email`.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>`<source>.users`</td>
    <td>A table with unique `identify` calls. `identify` calls are upserted on `user_id` into this table (updated if an existing entry exists, appended otherwise). This table holds the latest state of of a user. The `id` column in the users table is equivalent to the `user_id` column in the identifies table. Also note that this table won't have an `anonymous_id` column since a user can have multiple anonymousIds. To get at a user's anonymousIds, you'll need to query the identifies table. *If you observe any duplicates in the users table, please [contact us](/contact).*</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>`<source>.pages`</td>
    <td>A table with all of your `page` method calls. This table will include all of the `properties` you record for pages as top-level columns, for example `<source>.pages.title`.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>`<source>.screens`</td>
    <td>A table with all of your `screen` method calls. This table will include all of the `properties` you record for screens as top-level columns, for example `<source>.screens.title`.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>`<source>.tracks`</td>
    <td>A table with all of your `track` method calls. This table will only include a few standardized properties that are all common to all events: `anonymous_id`, `context_*`, `event`, `event_text`, `received_at`, `sent_at`, and `user_id`.  This is because every event that you send to Segment has completely different properties.  For querying by the custom properties, use the `<source>.<event>` tables instead.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>`<source>.<event>`</td>
    <td>For `track` calls, each event like `Signed Up` or `Order Completed` also has it's own table (eg. `initech.clocked_in`) with columns for each of the event's distinct `properties` (eg. `initech.clocked_in.time`).</td>
  </tr>
</table>


### Identifies

Your `identifies` table is where all of your `.identify()` method calls are stored. Query it to find out user-level information. It has the following columns:

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>`anonymous_id`</td>
    <td>The anonymous ID of the user.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>`context_<key>`</td>
    <td>Non-user-related context fields sent with each identify call.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>`id`</td>
    <td>The unique ID of the identify call itself.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>`received_at`</td>
    <td>When the identify call was received by Segment.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>`sent_at`</td>
    <td>When the identify call was triggered by the user.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>`user_id`</td>
    <td>The unique ID of the user.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>`<trait>`</td>
    <td>Each trait of the user you record is created as it's own column, and the column type is automatically inferred from your data. For example, you might have columns like `email` and `first_name`.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

To see a list of the columns in the `identifies` table for your `<source>` run:

```sql
SELECT column_name AS Columns
FROM columns
WHERE schema_name = '<source>'
AND table_name = 'identifies'
ORDER by column_name
```


<table>
  <thead>
    <tr><td>**Columns**</td></tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr><td>anonymous_id</td></tr>
    <tr><td>context_ip</td></tr>
    <tr><td>email</td></tr>
    <tr><td>...</td></tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

Your `identifies` table is where you can do all sorts of querying about your users and their traits. For example, if you wanted to see the number of unique users you've seen on your site each day:

```sql
SELECT DATE(sent_at) AS Day, COUNT(DISTINCT(user_id)) AS Users
FROM <source>.identifies
GROUP BY day
ORDER BY day
```


### Groups

Your `groups` table is where all of your `group` method calls are stored. Query it to find out group-level information. It has the following columns:

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>`anonymous_id`</td>
    <td>The anonymous ID of the user.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>`context_<key>`</td>
    <td>Non-user-related context fields sent with each group call.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>`group_id`</td>
    <td>The unique ID of the group.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>`id`</td>
    <td>The unique ID of the group call itself.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>`received_at`</td>
    <td>When the group call was received by Segment.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>`sent_at`</td>
    <td>When the group call was triggered by the user.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>`user_id`</td>
    <td>The unique ID of the user.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>`<trait>`</td>
    <td>Each trait of the group you record is created as it's own column, and the column type is automatically inferred from your data. For example, you might have columns like `email` and `name`.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr><td>anonymous_id</td></tr>
    <tr><td>context_ip</td></tr>
    <tr><td>...</td></tr>

SELECT name AS Company
FROM <source>.groups
GROUP BY name
```


<table>
  <thead>
    <tr><td>**Company**</td></tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr><td>Comcast</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Rdio</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Warner Brothers</td></tr>
    <tr><td>...</td></tr>
  </tbody>
</table>


### Pages & Screens

Your `pages` and `screens` tables are where all of your `page` and `screen` method calls are stored. Query it to find out information about page views or screen views. It has the following columns:

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>`anonymous_id`</td>
    <td>The anonymous ID of the user.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>`context_<key>`</td>
    <td>Non-user-related context fields sent with each page or screen call.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>`id`</td>
    <td>The unique ID of the page or screen call itself.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>`received_at`</td>
    <td>When the page or screen call was received by Segment.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>`sent_at`</td>
    <td>When the page or screen call was triggered by the user.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>`user_id`</td>
    <td>The unique ID of the user.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>`<property>`</td>
    <td>Each property of your pages or screens is created as it's own column, and the column type is automatically inferred from your data. For example, you might have columns like `referrer` and `title`.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

To see a list of the columns in the `pages` table for your `<source>` run:

```sql
SELECT column_name AS Columns
FROM columns
WHERE schema_name = '<source>'
AND table_name = 'pages'
ORDER by column_name
```


<table>
  <thead>
    <tr><td>**Columns**</td></tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr><td>`anonymous_id`</td></tr>
    <tr><td>`context_ip`</td></tr>
    <tr><td>`referrer`</td></tr>
    <tr><td>`...`</td></tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

The pages table can give you interesting information about page views that happen on your site, for example you can see the number of page views grouped by week:

```sql
SELECT DATE(sent_at) AS Day, COUNT(*) AS Views
FROM <source>.pages
GROUP BY day
ORDER BY day
```

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <td>**Day**</td>
      <td>**Views**</td>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tr>
    <td>2015-01-14</td>
    <td>2,203,198</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>2015-01-15</td>
    <td>2,393,020</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>2015-07-21</td>
    <td>1,920,290</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>...</td>
    <td>...</td>
  </tr>
</table>


### Tracks

Your `tracks` table is where all of your `track` method calls are stored. Query it to find out information about the events your users have triggered. It has the following columns:

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>`anonymous_id`</td>
    <td>The anonymous ID of the user.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>`context_<key>`</td>
    <td>Non-user-related context fields sent with each track call.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>`event`</td>
    <td>The slug of the event name, mapping to an event-specific table.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>`event_text`</td>
    <td>The name of the event.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>`id`</td>
    <td>An ID attached to the event at execution time and used for deduplication at the server level. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>`received_at`</td>
    <td>When the track call was received by Segment.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>`sent_at`</td>
    <td>When the track call was triggered by the user.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>`user_id`</td>
    <td>The unique ID of the user.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

Your `tracks` table is a rollup of all of the different event-specific tables, for quick querying of just a single type. For example, you could see the count of how many unique users signed up each day:

```sql
SELECT DATE(sent_at) AS Day, COUNT(DISTINCT(user_id)) AS Users
FROM segment.tracks
WHERE event = 'signed_up'
GROUP BY day
ORDER BY day
```


<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <td>**Day**</td>
      <td>**Users**</td>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tr>
    <td>2015-01-14</td>
    <td>25,198</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>2015-01-15</td>
    <td>31,020</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>2015-07-21</td>
    <td>19,290</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>...</td>
    <td>...</td>
  </tr>
</table>


### Event Tables

Your event tables are a series of table for each custom event you record to Segment. We break them out into their own tables because the properties, and thus the columns, differ for each event. Query these tables to find out information about specific properties of your custom events. They have the following columns:

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>`anonymous_id`</td>
    <td>The anonymous ID of the user.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>`context_<key>`</td>
    <td>Non-user-related context fields sent with each track call.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>`event`</td>
    <td>The slug of the event name, so you can join the `tracks` table.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>`event_text`</td>
    <td>The name of the event.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>`id`</td>
    <td>The unique ID of the track call itself.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>`received_at`</td>
    <td>When the track call was received by Segment.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>`sent_at`</td>
    <td>When the track call was triggered by the user.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>`user_id`</td>
    <td>The unique ID of the user.</td>
  </tr>
    <td>`<property>`</td>
    <td>Each property of your track calls is created as it's own column, and the column type is automatically inferred from your data.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

To see a list of all of the event tables for a given `<source>` you can run:

```sql
SELECT schema as source, "table" as Event
FROM disk
WHERE schema = '<source>'
  AND "table" != 'aliases'
  AND "table" != 'groups'
  AND "table" != 'identifies'
  AND "table" != 'pages'
  AND "table" != 'screens'
  AND "table" != 'tracks'
ORDER BY "table"
```


<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <td>**source**</td>
      <td>**Event**</td>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>production</td>
      <td>signed_up</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>production</td>
      <td>completed_order</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>...</td>
      <td>...</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

To see a list of the columns in one of your event tables run:

```sql
SELECT column_name AS Columns
FROM columns
WHERE schema_name = '<source>'
AND table_name = '<event>'
ORDER by column_name
```


<table>
  <thead>
    <tr><td>**Columns**</td></tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr><td>anonymous_id</td></tr>
    <tr><td>context_ip</td></tr>
    <tr><td>...</td></tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

**Note:** If you send us an array, we will stringify it in Redshift. That way you don't end up having to pollute your events. It won't work perfectly if you have a lot of array elements but should work decently to store and query those. We also flatten nested objects. 

### Tracks vs. Events Tables

To see all of the tables for your organization, you can run this query:

```sql
SELECT schema || '.' || "table" AS table, rows
FROM disk
ORDER BY 1
```

The  source.event tables have all of the same columns as the source.track tables, but they also include columns specific to the properties of each event.

So if you’re recording an event like:

```js
analytics.track('Register', {
  plan: 'Pro Annual',
  accountType: 'Facebook'
});
```

Then you can expect to see columns named `plan` and `account_type` as well as the default `event`, `id`, etc. That way you can write queries against any of the custom data send in track calls.

**Note:** Because `properties` and `traits` are added as un-prefixed columns to your tables, there is a chance of collision with our reserved column names. For this reason, properties with the same name as reserved column name (eg. `user_id`) will be discarded.

Your event tables are one of the more powerful datasets in Segment SQL. They allow you to clearly see which actions users are performing when interacting with your product.

Because every source has different events, what you can do with them will vary. Here's an example where you can see how many "Enterprise" users signed up for each day:

```sql
SELECT DATE(sent_at) AS Day, COUNT(DISTINCT(user_id)) AS Users
FROM <source>.signed_up
WHERE account_type = 'Enterprise'
GROUP BY day
ORDER BY day
```


<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <td>**Day**</td>
      <td>**Users**</td>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tr>
    <td>2015-01-14</td>
    <td>258</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>2015-01-15</td>
    <td>320</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>2015-07-21</td>
    <td>190</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>...</td>
    <td>...</td>
  </tr>
</table>

Here's an example that queries the daily revenue for an ecommerce store:

```sql
SELECT DATE(sent_at) AS Day, SUM(total) AS Revenue
FROM <source>.completed_order
GROUP BY day
ORDER BY day
```


<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <td>**Day**</td>
      <td>**Revenue**</td>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tr>
    <td>2014-07-19</td>
    <td>$2,630</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>2014-07-20</td>
    <td>$1,595</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>2014-07-21</td>
    <td>$2,350</td>
  </tr>
</table>

#### New Columns

Columns are created for new event properties and traits. We process the incoming data to Segment in batches, based on either data size or an interval of time. If the table doesn’t exist we lock and create the table. If the table exists but new columns need to be created, we perform a diff and alter the table to append new columns.

**Note:** We create tables for each of your custom events, and columns for each event's custom properties. Redshift itself has limits on how many can be created, so we do not allow unbounded event or property spaces in your data. Instead of recording events like "Ordered Product 15", use a single property of "Product Number" or similar._

When we process a new batch and discover a new column needs to be added, we take the most recent occurrence of a column and choose its datatype.

The datatypes that we support right now are: 

-`timestamp`
-`integer` 
-`float`
-`boolean`
-`varchar`

### Column Sizing

After analyzing the data from dozens of customers we set the string column length limit at 512 characters. Longer strings are truncated. We found this was the sweet spot for good performance and ignoring non-useful data.

We special-case compression for some known columns like event names and timestamps. The others default to LZO. We may add look-ahead sampling down the road, but from inspecting the datasets today this would be unnecessary complexity.

After a column is created, Redshift doesn’t allow altering. Swapping and renaming may work down the road, but this would likely cause thrashing and performance issues. If you would like to change the column size, see our [docs here](/docs/faqs/warehouses/redshift-limitations/#varchar-size-limits-).

### Timestamps

There are four timestamps associated with every Segment API call: `timestamp`, `original_timestamp`, `sent_at` and `received_at`.

All four timestamps are passed through to your Warehouse for every ETL’d event. In most cases the timestamps are fairly close together, but they have different meanings which are important.

`timestamp` is the UTC-converted timestamp which is set by the Segment library. If you are importing historical events via a server-side library, this is the timestamp you’ll want to reference in your queries!

`original_timestamp` is the original timestamp set by the Segment library at the time the event is created.  Keep in mind, this timestamp can be affected by device clock skew. You can override this value by manually passing in a value for `timestamp` which will then be relabed as `original_timestamp`. Generally, this timestamp should be ignored in favor of the `timestamp` column.

`sent_at` is the UTC timestamp set by library when the Segment API call was sent.  This timestamp can also be affected by device clock skew.

`received_at` is UTC timestamp set by the Segment API when the API receives the payload from client or server. All tables use `received_at` for the sort key.

**IMPORTANT:** We highly recommend using the `received_at` timestamp for all queries based on time. The reason for this is two-fold. First, the `sent_at` timestamp relies on a client’s device clock being accurate, which is generally unreliable. Secondly, we set `received_at` as the sort key in Redshift schemas, which means queries will execute much faster when using `received_at`. You can continue to use `timestamp` or `sent_at` timestamps in queries if `received_at` doesn’t work for your analysis, but the queries will take longer to complete.

However, `received_at` does not ensure chronology of events.  For queries based on event chronology, `timestamp` should be used.

[Here's additional documentation](/docs/spec/common/#timestamps) on timestamps in the context of our spec.

### id

Each row in your database will have an `id` which is equivalent to the messageId which is passed through in the raw JSON events. The `id` is a unique message id associated with the row.

### uuid and uuid_ts

The `uuid` column is used to prevent duplicates. You can ignore this column.

The `uuid_ts` column is used to keep track of when the specific event was last processed by our connector, specifically for deduping and debugging purposes. You can generally ignore this column.

### Sort Key

All tables use `received_at` for the sort key. Amazon Redshift stores your data on disk in sorted order according to the sort key. The Redshift query optimizer uses sort order when it determines optimal query plans.
