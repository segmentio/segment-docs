title: Auto-Instrumentation Setup
hidden: true

This guide outlines the steps required to set up the Signals SDK in your JavaScript website.

You'll learn how to add Auto-Instrumentation sources, integrate dependencies, and ensure that your setup captures and processes data as intended.  

> info "Auto-Instrumentation Pilot"
> Auto-Instrumentation is currently in pilot and is governed by Segment's [First Access and Beta Preview Terms](https://www.twilio.com/en-us/legal/tos){:target="_blank"}. Segment doesn't recommend Auto-Instrumentation for use in a production environment, as Segment is actively iterating on and improving the user experience.

## Step 1: Add a source and get its write key

You'll first need to add a source and copy its write key: 

1. In your Segment workspace, navigate to **Connections > Auto-Instrumentation** and click **Add source**.
2. Select a source, give the source a name, and click **Save**.
3. Return to **Connections > Sources** to view your sources. 
4. In the **My sources** table, find and click the new source you just set up.
5. In the **Initialize the Client** section, look for and copy the `writeKey` displayed in the code block. 

## Step 2: Add dependencies and initialization code

Next, you'll need to add the Signals SDKs to your web environment. 

Follow these steps to integrate the Signals SDK into your website:

1. Add the Signals SDK to your project: 

```bash
    # npm
    npm install @segment/analytics-signals
    # yarn
    yarn add @segment/analytics-signals
    # pnpm
    pnpm install @segment/analytics-signals 
```

2. Add the initialization code and configuration options:

> success ""
> see [configuration options](#configuration-options) for a complete list.

```ts
// analytics.js/ts
import { AnalyticsBrowser } from '@segment/analytics-next'
import { SignalsPlugin } from '@segment/analytics-signals'

const analytics = new AnalyticsBrowser()
const signalsPlugin = new SignalsPlugin()
analytics.register(signalsPlugin)

analytics.load({
  writeKey: '<YOUR_WRITE_KEY>'
})
```

Verify that you replaced `<WRITE_KEY>` with the actual write key you copied in Step 1.

4. Build and run your app.

## Step 3: Verify and deploy events

Next, you'll need to verify signal emission and [create rules](/docs/connections/auto-instrumentation/configuration/#example-rule-implementations) to convert those signals into events:

1. In your Segment workspace, return to **Connections > Auto-Instrumentation** and click on the new source you created. 
2. Verify that signals appear as expected on the dashboard.

3. Click **Create Rules**.
4. In the Rules Editor, add a rule that converts signal data into an event.
5. Click **Preview**, then click **Save & Deploy**.

Segment displays `Rule updated successfully` to verify that it saved your rule.

### Debugging
#### Enable debug mode
Values sent to the signals API are redacted by default.
This adds a local storage key.  To disable redaction, add a magic query string:
```
https://my-website.com?segment_signals_debug=true
```
You can *turn off debugging* by doing:
```
https://my-website.com?segment_signals_debug=false
```

### Advanced

#### Emitting custom signals 
If you need to listen for data that is unavailable to the Signals plugin by default, you can create and emit a custom signal:

```ts
import { signalsPlugin } from './analytics' // assuming you exported your plugin instance.

signalsPlugin.addSignal({
  type: 'userDefined',
  data: { foo: 'bar' }
})
```

#### Listening to signals
```ts
const signalsPlugin = new SignalsPlugin()
signalsPlugin.onSignal((signal) => console.log(signal))
```

### Emitting Signals
```ts
const signalsPlugin = new SignalsPlugin()
signalsPlugin.addSignal({
  type: 'userDefined',
  data: { foo: 'bar' }
})
```

## Configuration Options

Using the Signals Configuration object, you can control the destination, frequency, and types of signals that Segment automatically tracks within your application. The following table details the configuration options for Signals-Kotlin.

| `Option`            | Required | Value                     | Description                                                                                                                                                                                           |

| `writeKey`          | Yes      | string                    | Source write key                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| `maxBufferSize` | No       | number                  | The number of signals to be kept for JavaScript inspection. This buffer is first-in, first-out. Default is `1000`.                                                                                    |
| `processSignal` | No       | string                  | Override the default signal processing function from the edge function. If this is set, the edge function will not be used.
| `enableDebugLogging` | No       | boolean                  | Enable debug logs.
| `disableSignalRedaction` | No       | boolean                  | Disable default Signal data redaction.
| `apiHost` | No       | string                 | Override the default signals API host. Default is `signals.segment.io/v1`.
| `functionHost` | No       | string                 | Override the default edge host. Default is `cdn.edgefn.segment.com`
| `flushAt` | No       | number                   | How many signals to flush at once when sending to the signals API. Default is `5` .                                                                                                                                         |
| `flushInterval`      | No       | number | How many ms to wait before flushing signals to the API. The default is `2000`. |
