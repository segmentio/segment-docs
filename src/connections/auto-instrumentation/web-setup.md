title: Auto-Instrumentation Setup
hidden: true
---

This guide outlines the steps required to set up the Signals SDK in your JavaScript website.

Learn how to connect an existing source, integrate dependencies, turn on Auto-Instrumentation, and verify that your setup captures and processes data as intended.

> info "Auto-Instrumentation in public beta"
> Auto-Instrumentation is in public beta, and Segment is actively working on this feature. Some functionality may change before it becomes generally available.

## Step 1: Get your source write key

You need the `writeKey` from an existing Segment source. To find it:

1. In your Segment workspace, go to **Connections > Sources**.
2. Select your source.
3. From the source's overview tab, go to **Settings > API Keys**.
4. Copy the `writeKey` shown in the code block.

## Step 2: Add dependencies and initialization code

Next, add the Signals SDKs to your web environment.

Choose the installation method that matches your setup:  

- **Option A:** For websites loading Segment through the HTML snippet.  
- **Option B:** For projects using npm, yarn, or pnpm.

### Option A: Websites using the Segment snippet (HTML)

> warning ""
> Include only one Segment snippet per page. Replacing your existing snippet prevents duplicate `analytics.load()` calls.

If your site uses the standard Segment snippet, **replace it** with the following version, which includes the Signals SDK:

```html
<head>
  <title>My Website</title>
  <!-- Replace <YOUR_WRITE_KEY> in 'data-segment-write-key' -->
  <script data-segment-write-key="<YOUR_WRITE_KEY>">
    !(function () {
      var i = "analytics",
        analytics = (window[i] = window[i] || []);
      if (!analytics.initialize)
        if (analytics.invoked)
          window.console &&
            console.error &&
            console.error("Segment snippet included twice.");
        else {
          analytics.invoked = !0;
          analytics.methods = [
            "trackSubmit",
            "trackClick",
            "trackLink",
            "trackForm",
            "pageview",
            "identify",
            "reset",
            "group",
            "track",
            "ready",
            "alias",
            "debug",
            "page",
            "screen",
            "once",
            "off",
            "on",
            "addSourceMiddleware",
            "addIntegrationMiddleware",
            "setAnonymousId",
            "addDestinationMiddleware",
            "register",
          ];
          analytics.factory = function (e) {
            return function () {
              if (window[i].initialized)
                return window[i][e].apply(window[i], arguments);
              var n = Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments);
              if (
                [
                  "track",
                  "screen",
                  "alias",
                  "group",
                  "page",
                  "identify",
                ].indexOf(e) > -1
              ) {
                var c = document.querySelector("link[rel='canonical']");
                n.push({
                  __t: "bpc",
                  c: (c && c.getAttribute("href")) || void 0,
                  p: location.pathname,
                  u: location.href,
                  s: location.search,
                  t: document.title,
                  r: document.referrer,
                });
              }
              n.unshift(e);
              analytics.push(n);
              return analytics;
            };
          };
          for (var n = 0; n < analytics.methods.length; n++) {
            var key = analytics.methods[n];
            analytics[key] = analytics.factory(key);
          }
          analytics._writeKey = document.currentScript.getAttribute("data-segment-write-key");

          var r = document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];
          analytics.load = function (key, n) {
            var t = document.createElement("script");
            t.type = "text/javascript";
            t.async = !0;
            t.setAttribute("data-global-segment-analytics-key", i);
            t.src =
              "https://cdn.segment.com/analytics.js/v1/" +
              key +
              "/analytics.min.js";
            r.parentNode.insertBefore(t, r);
            analytics._loadOptions = n;
          };

          analytics.loadWithSignals = function (key, n) {
            var signalsScript = document.createElement("script");
            signalsScript.type = "text/javascript";
            signalsScript.src =
              "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@segment/analytics-signals@latest/dist/umd/analytics-signals.umd.js";
            signalsScript.async = !0;
            r.parentNode.insertBefore(signalsScript, r);
            signalsScript.onload = function () {
              var signalsPlugin = new SignalsPlugin();
              analytics.register(signalsPlugin);
              analytics.load(key, n)
            };
          };

          analytics.loadWithSignals(analytics._writeKey)
          analytics.page()
        }
    })();
  </script>
</head>
```

Verify that you only have **one snippet** in your site, then move on to [Step 4: Verify and deploy events](#step-4-verify-and-deploy-events).

### Option B: Install with a package manager 

1. Add the Signals SDK to your project:
  ```bash
  # npm
  npm install @segment/analytics-signals
  # yarn
  yarn add @segment/analytics-signals
  # pnpm
  pnpm install @segment/analytics-signals
  ```

2. Add the initialization code and configuration options:

  > success ""
  > see [configuration options](#configuration-options) for a complete list.

  ```ts
  // analytics.js/ts
  import { AnalyticsBrowser } from "@segment/analytics-next";
  import { SignalsPlugin } from "@segment/analytics-signals";

  export const analytics = new AnalyticsBrowser();

  const signalsPlugin = new SignalsPlugin();

  analytics.register(signalsPlugin);

  analytics.load({
    writeKey: "<YOUR_WRITE_KEY>",
  });
  ```

  Verify that you replaced `<YOUR_WRITE_KEY>` with the actual write key you copied in Step 1.

3. Build and run your app.

## Step 3: Turn on Auto-Instrumentation in your source

Next, return to the source settings to turn on Auto-Instrumentation:

1. Go to **Connections > Sources**.
2. Select the source you used in Step 1.
3. From the source's overview tab, go to **Settings > Analytics.js**.
4. Toggle Auto-Instrumention on.

## Step 4: Verify and deploy events

After integrating the SDK and running your app, verify that Segment is collecting signals:

1. In your Segment workspace, go to **Connections > Sources** and select the source you used for Auto-Instrumentation.
2. In the source overview, look for the **Event Builder** tab. If the tab doesnâ€™t appear:
  - Make sure you've installed the SDK correctly.
  - Verify that Auto Instrumentation is enabled in **Settings > Analytics.js**.
    ![The Event Builder tab shown in the navigation bar between Debugger and Schema in a Segment Source](images/event_builder_tab.png)

3. Open the **Event Builder** and follow the on-screen instructions to start signal detection.
  - To collect signals in the UI, visit your site in a browser using the query string:`?segment_signals_debug=true`.
4. Interact with your app to trigger signals: click buttons, navigate pages, submit forms, and so on. Segment collects and displays these as signals in real time.
5. From the signals list, click **Configure event** to define a new event based on one or more signals. After configuring the event, click **Publish event rules**.

### Debugging

#### Enable debug mode

User activity is not collected by default after SDK installation. To collect activity for use in building event rules, append the `segment_signals_debug=true` URL parameter.

```
https://my-website.com?segment_signals_debug=true
```
Loading the site with this debug URL parameter stays active in session storage until the tab or window is closed. Within a session the URL parameter does not need to be present on each page load.

You can _turn off debugging_ by doing:

```
https://my-website.com?segment_signals_debug=false
```

### Advanced

#### Emitting custom signals

If you need to listen for data that is unavailable to the Signals plugin by default, you can create and emit a custom signal:

```ts
var signalsPlugin = new SignalsPlugin(); // or use the global variable if you registered it globally
signalsPlugin.addSignal({ someData: 'foo' })


// emits a signal with the following shape
{
  type: 'userDefined'
  data: { someData: 'foo', ...  }
}
```

#### Listening to signals

```ts
const signalsPlugin = new SignalsPlugin();
signalsPlugin.onSignal((signal) => console.log(signal));
```

#### Middleware / Plugins

You can drop or modify signals using middleware:

```ts
import { SignalsPlugin, SignalsMiddleware } from "@segment/analytics-signals";

class MyMiddleware implements SignalsMiddleware {
  process(signal: Signal) {
    // drop all instrumentation signals
    if (signal.type === "instrumentation") {
      return null;
    } else {
      return signal;
    }
  }
}

const signalsPlugin = new SignalsPlugin({
  middleware: [new MyMiddleware()],
});
analytics.register(signalsPlugin);
```

#### Sandbox strategies

If you get CSP errors, you can use the experimental 'global' sandbox strategy:

```ts
new SignalsPlugin({ sandboxStrategy: "global" });
```

## Configuration options

Using the Signals Configuration object, you can control the destination, frequency, and types of signals that Segment automatically tracks within your application. The following table details the configuration options for Signals Web.

## Core Signal Types

Auto-Instrumentation collects different types of signals automatically:

### `interaction`

Interaction signals emit in response to a user interaction (like clicks or form submissions)

### `instrumentation`

Instrumentation signals emit whenever a Segment event is emitted.

### `navigation`

Navigation signals emit whenever the URL changes.

> Note: you can also rely on the initial analytics.page() call, which you can access as an Instrumentation signal.

### `network`

Network signals emit when an HTTP Request is made, or an HTTP Response is received. To emit a network signal, the network activity must have the following requirements:

- Initiated using the `fetch` API
- First party domain (for example, if on `foo.com`, then `foo.com/api/products`, but not `bar.com/api/products`)
- Contains the content-type: `application/json`
