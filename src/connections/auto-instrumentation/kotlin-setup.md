title: Auto-Instrumentation Setup
hidden: true

This guide outlines the steps required to set up the Signals SDK in your Android OS applications using Kotlin.

You'll learn how to add Auto-Instrumentation sources, integrate dependencies, and ensure that your setup captures and processes data as intended.  

> info "Auto-Instrumentation Pilot"
> Auto-Instrumentation is currently in pilot and is governed by Segment's [First Access and Beta Preview Terms](https://www.twilio.com/en-us/legal/tos){:target="_blank"}. Segment doesn't recommend Auto-Instrumentation for use in a production environment, as Segment is actively iterating on and improving the user experience.

## Step 1: Add a source and get its write key

You'll first need to add a source and copy its write key: 

1. In your Segment workspace, navigate to **Connections > Auto-Instrumentation** and click **Add source**.
2. Select a source, give the source a name, and click **Save**.
3. Return to **Connections > Sources** to view your sources. 
4. In the **My sources** table, find and click the new source you just set up.
5. In the **Initialize the Client** section, look for and copy the `writeKey` displayed in the code block. 

## Step 2: Add dependencies and initialization code

Next, you'll need to add the Signals SDKs to your Kotlin application.

1. Update your moduleâ€™s Gradle build file to add the right dependencies:

    ```kotlin
    dependencies {
        // Add the Analytics Kotlin library
        implementation("com.segment.analytics.kotlin:android:1.15.0")
        // Add a live plugin for real-time data handling
        implementation("com.segment.analytics.kotlin:analytics-kotlin-live:1.0.0")
        // Add the core Signals library
        implementation("com.segment.analytics.kotlin.signals:core:0.0.1")
        // Compose plugin for Jetpack Compose UI tracking
        implementation("com.segment.analytics.kotlin.signals:compose:0.0.1")
        // OkHttp3 plugin for network activity tracking
        implementation("com.segment.analytics.kotlin.signals:okhttp3:0.0.1")
    }
    ```

2. Add the initialization code and configuration options:

> success ""
> see [configuration options](#configuration-options) for a complete list.

    ```kotlin
    // Configure Analytics with your settings
    {... <analytics config>....} 

    // Add live plugins for real-time analytics
    analytics.add(LivePlugins())

    // Configure and add the Signals plugin
    Signals.configuration = Configuration(
        writeKey = "<WRITE_KEY>",  // Replace <WRITE_KEY> with the write key you previously copied
        maximumBufferSize = 1000,
        broadcasters = listOf(SegmentBroadcaster(analytics))
    )

    // Add the Compose plugin for UI events and screen tracking
    analytics.add(SignalsComposeTrackingPlugin())
    ```

3. (Optional:) If you want to track network activity, configure your OkHttpClient to use the Signals OkHttp3 plugin:

    ```kotlin
    private val okHttpClient = OkHttpClient.Builder()
        .addInterceptor(SignalsOkHttp3TrackingPlugin())
        .build()
    ```

4. Build and run your app.

## Step 3: Verify and deploy events

Next, you'll need to verify signal emission and [create rules](/docs/connections/auto-instrumentation/configuration/#example-rule-implementations) to convert those signals into events:

1. In your Segment workspace, return to **Connections > Auto-Instrumentation** and click on the new source you created. 
2. Verify that signals appear as expected on the dashboard.

3. Click **Create Rules**.
4. In the Rules Editor, add a rule that converts signal data into an event.
5. Click **Preview**, then click **Save & Deploy**.

Segment displays `Rule updated successfully` to verify that it saved your rule.

## Configuration Options

Using the Signals Configuration object, you can control the destination, frequency, and types of signals that Segment automatically tracks within your application. The following table details the configuration options for Signals-Kotlin.

| `Option`            | Required | Value                     | Description                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| ------------------- | -------- | ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `writeKey`          | Yes      | String                    | Source write key                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| `maximumBufferSize` | No       | Integer                   | The number of signals to be kept for JavaScript inspection. This buffer is first-in, first-out. Default is `1000`.                                                                                    |
| `broadcastInterval` | No       | Integer                   | Broadcasts signals to Segment every X event. Default is `60`.                                                                                                                                         |
| `broadcasters`      | No       | `List<SignalBroadcaster>` | An array of broadcasters. These objects forward signal data to their destinations, like `WebhookBroadcaster` or `DebugBroadcaster` writing to the developer console. Default is `SegmentBroadcaster`. |
