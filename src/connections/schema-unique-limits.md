title: Are there limits on my Segment Schema?
---

**How many unique events can be logged in my Segment Schema table?**

While you can technically track unlimited events with Segment, only the first 2,000 events will be visible on the Schema page for a given Source. After you hit the 2,000 event limit, all future events will still be tracked and sent to your Destinations based on your Schema Default settings. They will not, however, be logged in the Segment Schema table.

**How many unique event properties can be logged on the event details page?**

While you can technically track unlimited event properties with Segment, only the first 300 properties will be visible on the event details page for a given event. After you hit the 300 property limit, all future properties will still be tracked and sent to your Destinations. They will not, however, be logged on the event details page.

**How can I clear the Schema if I have hit the limits?**

If you hit any of the limits or would like to clear out old events or properties, you can clear the Schema data from your Source Settings. In your Source, navigate to Settings, then Schema Configuration. Scroll down to the **Clear Schema History** setting.
