## What is a source?

A source is a website, server library, mobile SDK, or cloud application which can send data into Segment. It’s where your data originates. Add a source to collect data to understand who your customers are and how they’re using your product. Create a source for each website or app you want to track. While it's not required that you have a single source for each server, site, or app, you should create a source for each unique source of data.

Each source you create has a write key, which is used to send data to that source. For example, to load [`analytics.js`, the Segment JavaScript library](https://segment.com/docs/connections/sources/catalog/libraries/website/javascript/) on your page, the snippet on the [Quickstart Guide](https://segment.com/docs/connections/sources/catalog/libraries/website/javascript/quickstart/) includes:


```js
analytics.identify('user_123', {
  email: 'jane.kim@example.com',
  name: 'Jane Kim'
  });
```

{% comment %}
{% codeexample %}
{% codeexampletab JavaScript %}
```js
analytics.identify('user_123', {
  email: 'jane.kim@example.com',
  name: 'Jane Kim'
  },
});
```
{% endcodeexampletab %}

{% codeexampletab HTML %}
```html
<div id="example"></div>
```
{% endcodeexampletab %}

{% codeexampletab CSS %}
```css
#example { color: red; }
```
{% endcodeexampletab %}
{% endcodeexample %}
{% endcomment %}


## Types of sources

Segment has three types of sources: 
* [Event streams](#event-streams-sources)
* [Cloud app objects](#cloud-app-sources)
* [Reverse ETL](#reverse-etl-sources) 


<!-- ## Types of sources

Segment has five types of sources:
* [Web](#website-libraries)
* [Mobile](#mobile)
* [Server](#server)
* [Cloud App](#cloud-apps)
  * [Object Cloud](#object-cloud-sources)
  * [Event Cloud](#event-cloud-sources)
* User-created [Source Functions](/docs/connections/sources/source-functions/)


Web, Mobile, and Server sources send first-party data from your digital properties. Cloud-app sources send data about your users from your connected web apps such as [Zendesk](/docs/connections/sources/catalog/cloud-apps/zendesk/),  [Stripe](/docs/connections/sources/catalog/cloud-apps/stripe/), and [Braze](/docs/connections/sources/catalog/cloud-apps/braze/). -->

## Create a source
To create a source:
1. Navigate to **Connections** and click **Add Source**.
2. Click the Source you’d like to add. *Note:* More than 80% of workspaces start by adding their JavaScript website.
3. Click **Add Source**.
4. Enter a name for your source as well as any information on the setup page.
5. Click **Add Source**.

> info "One source or multiple sources?"
> Segment suggests that you create one source for each type of data you want to collect. For example, you might have one source for all of your website tracking and a different source for any mobile tracking. Creating one source per data type provides the following benefits:
> - Debugger ease of use - mixing libraries/sources on a single API key means you’re heavily reliant on filtering to actually test events
> - Flexibility sending data to different projects - if you want to have different warehouse schemas, analytics projects, etc, having multiple sources would create this separation
> - More control - as your account grows with the number of destinations you enable, having separate sources allows you to have more control
> - A source type cannot be changed once it is created. You must create a new source if you would like to use a different source type.

## Event streams sources 
Event streams sources collect data from your website or app to monitor user actions. These sources include [website libraries](#website-libraries), [mobile](#mobile), and [server sources](#server). 

### Website libraries

[Analytics.js](/docs/connections/sources/catalog/libraries/website/javascript/), the JavaScript library, is the most powerful way to track customer data from your website. If you're just starting out, Segment recommends it over server-side libraries as the simplest installation for any website.

### Mobile

Segment's Mobile SDKs are the best way to simplify your iOS, Android, and Xamarin app tracking. Try them over server-side sources as the default installation for any mobile app.

- [AMP](/docs/connections/sources/catalog/libraries/mobile/amp)
- [Android](/docs/connections/sources/catalog/libraries/mobile/android)
- [Android Wear](/docs/connections/sources/catalog/libraries/mobile/android/wear)
- [iOS](/docs/connections/sources/catalog/libraries/mobile/ios)
- [Kotlin](/docs/connections/sources/catalog/libraries/mobile/kotlin-android/)
- [React Native](/docs/connections/sources/catalog/libraries/mobile/react-native)
- [Swift](/docs/connections/sources/catalog/libraries/mobile/swift-ios/)
- [Xamarin](/docs/connections/sources/catalog/libraries/mobile/xamarin)

### Server

Segment's server-side sources let you send analytics data directly from your servers. Segment recommends tracking from your servers when device-mode tracking (tracking on the client) doesn't work. Check out the [guide on server-side tracking](/docs/guides/how-to-guides/collect-on-client-or-server/) if you're not sure whether it makes sense for your use case.

{: .columns }
- [Clojure](/docs/connections/sources/catalog/libraries/server/clojure/)
- [Go](/docs/connections/sources/catalog/libraries/server/go/)
- [Java](/docs/connections/sources/catalog/libraries/server/java/)
- [Node.js](/docs/connections/sources/catalog/libraries/server/node/)
- [PHP](/docs/connections/sources/catalog/libraries/server/php/)
- [Python](/docs/connections/sources/catalog/libraries/server/python/)
- [Ruby](/docs/connections/sources/catalog/libraries/server/ruby/)
- [.NET](/docs/connections/sources/catalog/libraries/server/net/)

> info "Cloud-mode tracking"
> Server-side data management is when tag sends data to the Segment servers, which then passes that data to the destination system.


## Cloud app sources

Cloud app sources empower you to pull together data from all of your different third-party tools into a Segment warehouse or to your other enabled integrated tools. They send data about your users from your connected web apps. There are two types of Cloud Apps: [Object cloud sources](#object-cloud-sources) and [Event cloud sources](#event-cloud-sources).

{% include components/reference-button.html href="/docs/connections/sources/sources-compare/" icon="guides.svg" title="Comparing Cloud Sources" description="Wondering which cloud-apps send which types of data? Check out the Cloud Sources comparison." %}


### Object Cloud Sources

These Cloud App Sources can export data from its third party tool and import it directly into your Segment warehouse. Make sure you have a Segment warehouse enabled before you enable any of the following sources:

{: .columns }
{% capture source-type-list %} {% include content/cloud-source-type-list.md type="object" %} {%endcapture%}
{{source-type-list | markdownify}}


### Event Cloud Sources

These Cloud App Sources can not only export data into your Segment warehouse, but they can **also** federate the exported data into your other enabled Segment integrations:

{: .columns }
{% capture source-type-list %} {% include content/cloud-source-type-list.md type="event" %} {%endcapture%}
{{source-type-list | markdownify}}

### HTTP

If Segment doesn't have a library for your environment, you can send your data directly to the [HTTP Tracking API](/docs/connections/sources/catalog/libraries/server/http/). All of Segment's other sources and platforms use the HTTP API to work their magic behind the scenes.


### Pixel

Segment's [Pixel Tracking API](/docs/connections/sources/catalog/libraries/server/pixel-tracking-api/) lets you track events from environments where you can't execute code, like tracking email opens.

| Event name           | Description                                                                                                           |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Email Delivered      | The message has been successfully delivered to the receiving server.                                                   |
| Email Opened         | The recipient has opened the HTML message. You need to enable Open Tracking for getting this type of event.           |
| Email Link Clicked   | The recipient clicked on a link within the message. You need to enable Click Tracking for getting this type of event. |
| Email Bounced        | The receiving server could not or would not accept message.                                                           |
| Email Marked as Spam | The recipient marked message as spam.                                                                                 |
| Unsubscribe          | The recipient clicked on message's subscription management link.                                                      |

## Reverse ETL sources
Reverse ETL sources are data warehouses that enable you to use [Reverse ETL](/docs/connections/reverse-etl) to send data from your warehouse source to your destinations. 

Reverse ETL supports [these sources] and Segment is actively working on adding more. If you'd like to request Segment to add a particular source, please note it on the [feedback form](https://airtable.com/shriQgvkRpBCDN955){:target="_blank"}.
