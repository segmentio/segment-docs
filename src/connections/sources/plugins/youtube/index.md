With the analytics.js YouTube Plugin you can easily collect YouTube player events into the Segment ecosystem.

## Prerequisites
The Segment YouTube Plugin requires the YouTube player JavaScript object as an input, so your YouTube player embed must use the [YouTube IFrame player API](https://developers.google.com/youtube/iframe_api_reference#Getting_Started).

To begin, you'll need to generate an API Key for the Segment YouTube plugin, which it uses to access metadata about the video content being played. To do this, create a new project in the Google Developer Console, then create a new API Key in that project for the Segment YouTube plugin. You can read more about this process in the YouTube documentation on [registering an application](https://developers.google.com/youtube/registering_an_application).

## Getting Started

### 1. Enable

Enable a new plugin by navigating to the settings for your Source, and clicking  **Plugins**. You can enable the YouTube plugin from this menu.

**Note: At this time, only Javascript sources support plugins.**

### 2. Initialize
Initialize the plugin by giving it access to the YouTube video player instance(s) running on your page. Use the initialize method in the YouTube `onYouTubeIframeAPIReady()` function:
```js
var player;
function onYouTubeIframeAPIReady() {
    player = new YT.Player('player', {
    height: '390',
    width: '640',
    videoId: 'M7lc1UVf-VE'
    });
    <b>var ytAnalytics = new window.analyticsPlugins.YT(player, 'XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX0365')
    ytAnalytics.initialize()</b>
}
```

That's it! The plugin listens to the YouTube player for events, and fires the corresponding [Segment Video Spec](https://segment.com/docs/connections/spec/video/) events on Analytics.js.

## Supported Events
The following [Segment Video Spec](https://segment.com/docs/connections/spec/video/) events are tracked by this plugin:
- Video Playback Started
    - If playing a single video, this fires when the video starts
    - If playing a playlist, this fires when the first video in the playlist starts
- Video Playback Completed
    - If playing a single video, this fires when the video finishes
    - If playing a playlist, this event fires when the final video in the playlist finishes
- Video Playback Paused/Resumed
- Video Playback Buffer Started/Completed
- Video Playback Seek Started/Completed
- Video Content Started/Completed
    - For playlists, these events get fired for each individual video
