[Foursquare's Pilgrim SDK](https://developer.foursquare.com/pilgrimsdk) provides real-time event triggering based upon your usersâ€™ location in the physical world, allowing you to harness our powerful geotargeting capabilities to send those events to other services using Segment.

This destination is maintained by Foursquare. For any issues with the destination, [contact the Foursquare Developer Support team](mailto:developers@foursquare.com).

## Getting Started

1. From your Segment UI's Source page click on "Add Source".
2. Search for "Foursquare Pilgrim" within the Source Catalog and confirm the Source you'd like to connect to.
3. Once Foursquare is added as a source, copy your "Write Key".
4. Head over to your [Foursquare Developer Console](https://foursquare.com/developers/apps/) and create a new Segment integration in your Foursquare app's Pilgrim SDK console. There you can drop in your Segment "Write Key" into your Segment Integration Configuration screen.

## Events

Below is a table of events that Foursquare's Pilgrim SDK sends to Segment. These events will show up as tables in your warehouse, and as regular events in your other Destinations. Foursquare will send through the `userId` if available.

| Event Name | Description |
| -------- | -------- |
| placeArrival | Device has arrived at a venue. Usually occurs after 3-7 minutes. |
| placeDeparture | Device has left a visited venue. |
| placeHistorical | Device previously arrived or departed a venue, but the device didn't have network connectivity at the time, but we're letting you know as soon as we have connectivity again. |
| geofenceEnter | Device has entered a venue, polygon or lat/lng geofence. |
| geofenceDwell | Device has remained within geofence for pre-determined time. |
| geofenceVenueConfirmed | Device has dwelled within geofence AND Foursquare thinks this is actually the venue the device is at. |
| geofenceExit | Device has left geofence. |

## Adding Destinations

Now that your Source is set up, you can connect it with Destinations.

Log into your downstream tools and check that your events appear and contain all the expected properties. If events and properties do not appear, refer to the Destination docs for troubleshooting.

If you experience any issues with how the events arrive in Segment, [contact the Foursquare team](mailto:developers@foursquare.com).
