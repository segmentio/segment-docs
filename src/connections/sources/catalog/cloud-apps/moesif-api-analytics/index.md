[Moesif API Analytics](https://www.moesif.com/?utm_source=segmentio&utm_medium=docs&utm_campaign=partners) helps you drive API adoption, usage, and retention. With Moesif, track your customer journey from initial ad click to first API call while identifying at-risk customers struggling to integrate with your APIs.

The [Moesif SDKs and API gateway plugins](https://www.moesif.com/implementation?utm_source=segmentio&utm_medium=docs&utm_campaign=partners) are open-source and support REST, GraphQL, and other APIs.

This source is maintained by Moesif. For any issues with the source, [contact the Moesif team](mailto:support@moesif.com).

## Adding Destinations

Now that your Source is set up, you can connect it with Destinations.

Log into your downstream tools and check to see that your events are populating and they contains all the properties you expect. If all your events and properties are not showing up, refer to the Destination docs for troubleshooting.

If you experience any issues with how the events arrive in Segment, [contact the Moesif team](mailto:support@moesif.com).
