Braze is a marketing automation and customer engagement platform. Growth, Engagement, and Marketing teams use Braze to build great long term relationships with their customers across key digital channels.  

Take your company’s marketing and customer engagement to the next level by adding Braze as a Segment Source, via Braze's Currents product. We’ll automatically collect marketing and analytics events, forward them to your destinations, and load them into your data warehouse.

In your favorite BI or analytics tool, you’ll be able to analyze your mobile, email, and web marketing campaign data in SQL or through drag-and-drop reports. You’ll be able to join your Braze data with the event data you’re already sending through Segment to analyze the impacts of your marketing and engagement programs.

## Getting Started

1. From your workspace Overview page, click Add Source.
2. Choose Braze
3. Give the Source a name. The name will be used to identify this source within your workspace. You can name it however you’d like, but we recommend sticking to something that reflects the Source itself, like Braze.
4. The next page "Overview" will surface your Segment write key for Braze. Copy this write key.
5. To finish the setup, you need to activate "Currents" in Braze which requires reaching out to Braze Support or your Customer Support Manager. Braze Currents is only available in select Braze packages and cannot be configured within Braze without assistance from your Braze Customer Success representative.  


Now when you go back to Segment, click into your Braze Source and you’ll be able to add Destinations where you want to receive your Braze data. Events will now be sent to your destinations and automatically loaded into any warehouses you have enabled.

*NOTE*: The Braze Source is currently in Beta. **The names of Apps, Campaigns, Canvases (including Canvas Variations and Canvas Steps), and News Feed Cards will be made available as event properties in an upcoming version of the source, in addition to the API Identifiers already listed above**.

## User Identification

Braze will send the Braze `external_user_id` as the top level `userId` field. This is the same `userId` that Braze originally receives from the downstream destination with Segment. Braze will only send events associated with users who have an `external_user_id` set.

## Send Segment Data to Braze

The entire source with Braze can be even better if you also connect to it as a downstream destination within Segment. With Segment's Braze destination, you can send user and event data to Braze in order to target customers with messaging campaigns.
