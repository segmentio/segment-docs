[Braze](https://www.braze.com/?utm_source=segmentio&utm_medium=docs&utm_campaign=partners){:target="_blank"} is a marketing automation and customer engagement platform. Growth, Engagement, and Marketing teams use Braze to build great long term relationships with their customers across key digital channels.

Take your company's marketing and customer engagement to the next level by adding Braze as a Segment Source, using Braze's Currents product. Segment automatically  collects marketing and analytics events, forwards them to your destinations, and loads them into your data warehouse.

In your favorite BI or analytics tool, you'll be able to analyze your mobile, email, and web marketing campaign data in SQL or using drag-and-drop reports. You'll be able to join your Braze data with the event data you're already sending through Segment to analyze the impacts of your marketing and engagement programs.

Braze maintains this source. For any issues with the source, you can [contact the Braze Support team](https://www.braze.com/docs/support_contact/){:target="_blank"}.

> info ""
> If you're interested in using Braze, contact your Braze Customer Success Manager. Braze Currents is only available in select Braze packages and can't be configured without assistance from the Braze team.

## Getting Started

1. Go to **Connections > Sources** and click **Add Source** in the Segment app.
2. Search for **Braze** in the Sources Catalog and click **Add Source**.
3. Give the Source a nickname and click **Add Source**.
   The nickname is used as a label for the source in your Segment interface, and Segment creates a related schema name. The schema name is the namespace you'll query against in a warehouse. The nickname can be anything, but Segment recommends sticking to something that reflects the source itself and distinguishes amongst your environments (for example, `Braze_Prod`, `Braze_Staging`, `Braze_Dev`).
4. Copy the **Write Key** on the Overview page.
5. To finish the setup, contact Braze Support or your Customer Support Manager to activate Currents in Braze.
   - **Note:** Braze Currents is only available in select Braze packages and can't be configured within Braze without assistance from your Braze Customer Success representative. Select the appropriate **Supported Region** in the Braze Currents configuration if you are using a non U.S. Segment Region.
6. Go back to Segment and click **Add Destinations** in your Braze source to add the destinations where you want to receive your Braze data.

Events are now sent to these destinations and automatically loaded into any warehouses you enabled.

> warning ""
> The Braze Segment Currents integration doesn't isolate events by different apps in a single app group. If you create more than one of the same Currents connectors (for example, two message engagement event connectors), they must be in different app groups. If you don't do this, it leads to data deduping and lost data.

## Components

Braze uses Segment's [Stream Source component](/docs/partners/streams/) to send events to Segment. These events are then available in any Destination that accepts server-side events, including your data warehouse.

## Events

The following table lists events that Braze sends to Segment. These events show up as tables in your Warehouse and as regular events in your other Destinations.

Braze will send the Braze `external_user_id` as the top level `userId` field. This is the same `userId` that Braze originally receives from the downstream destination with Segment. Braze will only send events associated with users who have an `external_user_id` set.

This table lists event-specific properties Braze sends to Segment:

| Property Name           | Type     | Description                                                                                                            |
| ----------------------- | -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `in_control_group`      | String | For Canvas Entered events, whether or not the user was enrolled in the control group - always either `true` or `false`. |
| `context.traits.email`  | String | For Email events, the email address that the email was sent to.                                                        |
| `link_url`              | String | For Email Clicked events, the URL of the link that the user clicked on.                                                |
| `button_id`             | String | For In-App Message Clicked events, the index of the button the user clicked on.                                        |
| `card_id`               | String | For News Feed Card and Content Card events, the API Identifier of the Card.                                            |
| `state_change_source`   | String | Source of the state change (for example, REST, SDK, Dashboard, Preference Center, and more.)                                     |

| `machine_open`  | String | For Email Open events, indicator of whether the email was opened by an automated process, such as Apple or Google mail pre-fetching. Currently `true` or `null`, but additional granularity (for example, "Apple" or "Google" to indicate which process made the fetch) may be added in the future. |


Refer to Braze's [Segment for Currents documentation](https://www.braze.com/docs/partners/data_and_infrastructure_agility/customer_data_platform/segment/segment_for_currents/){:target="_blank"} for more information on Braze export events and properties.

## Adding Destinations

Now that your Source is set up, you can connect it with Destinations.

Log in to your downstream tools and make sure that the events are populating in your Debugger and that they contain all of the properties you expect. If something isn't working as you expect, see the Destination docs for troubleshooting.

If there are problems with how the events arrive to Segment, [contact the Braze team](https://www.braze.com/docs/support_contact/){:target="_blank"}.

## Sending Data To Braze

The Braze Source works better when you also connect Braze as a Destination. With the Braze Destination, you can use Segment to send event data to Braze so you can target customers with messaging campaigns. Want to start sending data to Braze? Learn how by reading the [Braze Destination docs](/docs/connections/destinations/catalog/braze/).
