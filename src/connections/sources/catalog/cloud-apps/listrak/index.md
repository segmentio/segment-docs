> The Listrak Source is in beta, and Listrak is still developing the source. To join Listrak's beta program or to give any feedback to help improve the Listrak Source and its documentation, [let Listrak know](mailto:support@listrak.com).

[Listrak](https://www.listrak.com/?utm_source=segmentio&utm_medium=docs&utm_campaign=partners){:target="_blank”} is the retail industry’s leading customer engagement platform. Listrak delivers results for more than 1,000 retailers by providing best-in-class email, text message marketing, identity resolution marketing and push notifications through seamless cross-channel orchestration. Listrak’s data-first approach delivers 1:1 personalization at scale so you can send messages at precisely the right time across the right combination of channels and devices to maximize customer engagement, revenue, and lifetime value.

This is an [Event Cloud Source](/docs/sources/#event-cloud-sources) which can not only export data into your Segment warehouse, but can also federate the exported data into your other enabled Segment Destinations.

This source is maintained by Listrak. For any issues with the source, [contact their Support team](mailto:support@listrak.com).

## Getting Started

1. From your workspace's [Sources catalog page](https://app.segment.com/goto-my-workspace/sources/catalog){:target="_blank"} click **Add Source**.
2. Search for "Listrak" in the Sources Catalog, select Listrak, and click **Add Source**.
3. On the next screen, give the Source a nickname and configure any other settings.

   - The nickname is used as a label in the Segment app, and Segment creates a related schema name in your warehouse. The nickname can be anything, but we recommend using something that reflects the source itself and distinguishes amongst your environments (eg. Listrak_Prod, Listrak_Staging, Listrak_Dev).

4. Click **Add Source** to save your settings.
5. Copy the Write key from the Segment UI.
6.  Log in to your [Listrak account](https://admin.listrak.com){:target="_blank"}, and navigate to Integrations > Integrations Management.
6. Click **New Integration**.
7. Click the Segment card
8. Click Setup Integration
9. Paste the Write key you copied from Segment and click **Save**.
10. Add at least one email list that you want to sync with Segment and click **Save**.

## Components

**Stream**

Listrak uses our stream Source component to send Segment event data. It uses a server-side `identify` method to send data to Segment. These events are then available in any destination that accepts server-side events, and available in a schema in your data warehouse, so you can query using SQL.

Listrak always sets the `anonymousId` and the `email` trait to the email address of the contact. 

If a profile field was entered when the email list was added to the integration and the email address has a value for that profile field, the `userId` will be set to that value. Otherwise, Listrak will not set the `userId`. 

Listrak maintains a trait for each email list you add to the integration. The trait is named `Listrak_list_{listId}`, where `{listId}` is the ID of the list (eg. `Listrak_list_12345`). The trait will be set to true if the email address is subscribed to the list. The trait will be removed if the email address is not subscribed to the list. This trait can be used to create Engage audiences that only contain profiles that are subscribed to a Listrak list.

## Adding Destinations

Now that your Source is set up, you can connect it with Destinations.

Log into your downstream tools and check to see that your events appear as expected and that they contain all of the properties you expect. If your events and properties don’t appear, check the [Event Delivery](/docs/connections/event-delivery/) tool and refer to the docs for each Destination.

If there are any issues with how the events are arriving to Segment, [contact the Listrak support team](mailto:support@listrak.com).
