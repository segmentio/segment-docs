Adding YOUBORA as a Source to Segment will allow you to use YOUBORA data with other Segment collected data.

These events can be passed to your Segment Destinations such as data warehouses and analytics tools. Joined with data from other marketing programs, you can start telling a unified story of each customer's journey and tailor your reporting to the KPIs that matter most.

## Getting Started

1. From your Sources page in Segment, click Add Source.
2. Choose YOUBORA.
3. Click Connect.
4. Give the Source a nickname. The nickname is a label used in the Segment interface.
5. Copy the Segment `write_key` for YOUBORA from the Overview page.
6. contact your YOUBORA representative to enable the event-source with the `write_key` provided.
7. Click Save.
8. From your Segment account, click into your YOUBORA Source and you will be able to add other downstream Destinations where you want to see the YOUBORA auto-tracked events.

You're all set! YOUBORA auto-tracked events will now be sent to Segment and any other destinations that you've enabled.

## Components

### Stream

YOUBORA uses our stream Source component to send events to Segment. These events are then available in any destination that accepts server-side events, including your data warehouse.

## Events

For now, YOUBORA is sending all the auto-tracked events as `Youbora Event`

## Adding Destinations

Now that your Source is set up, you can connect it with destinations.

Log into your downstream tools and check to see that your events are populating and they contains all the properties you expect. If all your events and properties are not showing up, refer to the destination docs for troubleshooting.

If you experience any issues with how the events arrive in Segment, [contact the YOUBORA team](https://nicepeopleatwork.com/contactus).

## User Identification

YOUBORA will only send in events that have a value for a `userId`. You must send in the same value for `userId` to YOUBORA as you are sending into Segment.
