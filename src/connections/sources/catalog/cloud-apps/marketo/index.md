<!-- Marketo is listed as an object source, but doesn't appear in our configapi source catalog, so leave the "source-type" set here -->

[Marketo](https://www.marketo.com/) is a leader in marketing automation. Using our Marketo source, we will load your campaigns, emails, leads and other collections into your data warehouse.

This will allow you to write SQL to analyze your analyze your email marketing campaigns ROI, or join your email data to other data sources like web and mobile events, Salesforce, and Zendesk to tie nurture emails to re-activation rates in your app.

## Getting Started

### Permissions

You will need Admin permissions to your Marketo account.

### Add a new Marketo source

1. From your workspace's `sources` page, click `add source`.
2. Choose Marketo.
3. Give the source a nickname and a schema name. The nickname is a label used in the Segment interface, and the schema name is the namespace you query against in your warehouse. Both can be whatever you like, but we recommend sticking to something that reflects the source itself, like Marketo for nickname and marketo or marketo_prod for the schema name.
4. Configure your Marketo source with the required settings (see section below for details)

2. Go to Admin > Munchkin to find your Munchkin Account ID

3. Go to Admin > LaunchPoint
  a. If you don't already have a REST service setup, follow [these steps](http://developers.marketo.com/rest-api/custom-services/).
  b. Then, copy the "Client ID" and "Client Secret" parameters.

  c. Paste the "Client ID" and "Client Secret" into the Segment Marketo source settings.

You're done! Data should start flowing into your Warehouse in the next few hours.


## Components

### Sync


The Marketo source is built with a sync component, which means we'll make requests to their API on your behalf on a 3 hour interval to pull the latest data into Segment. In the initial sync, we'll grab all the Marketo objects (and their corresponding properties) according to the Collections Table below. The objects will be written into a separate schema, corresponding to the source instance's schema name you designated upon creation (ie. my_source.charges).

Our sync component uses an upsert API, so the data in your warehouse loaded using sync will reflect the latest state of the corresponding resource in Marketo. For example, if `first_name` goes from `Jess` to `Jessica` between syncs, on its next sync that field will be `Jessica`.

The source syncs and warehouse syncs are independent processes. Source runs pull your data into the Segment Hub, and warehouse runs flush that data to your warehouse. Sources will sync with Segment every 3 hours. Depending on your Warehouses plan, we will push the Source data to your warehouse on the interval associated with your billing plan.

## Collections

## Adding Destinations

Currently, Warehouses are the only supported destination for object-cloud sources


## FAQs

### How many API calls will the Segment source use?

The Marketo API has different limits for the number of objects returned by different endpoints, but usually 100-300 objects per call.

At set up time, you have the option to specify a cap to the API calls that our source can consume. If no cap is specified, we will by default consume as many API calls that are available to sync the entire source.

We also use the Lead Activities bulk API to reduce the number of requests needed to sync the data; this however, also has a limit of 500MB worth of files downloaded per day.

If your source requires more than 10k calls or over 500MB from the bulk API to sync, we will continue the sync the following day when a new batch of API calls are available.

If you have other applications that use the Marketo API, this can interfere with their ability to make requests.

### What Marketo API are you using?

We're primarily using the REST API, but also use the Lead Activity Bulk API to reduce the number of requests needed to sync.

### Can I get other collections not default synced by the source?

Yes! [contact Support](https://segment.com/help/contact/) to request additional collections.

### Can I get other columns not default synced by the source?
Yes! For leads and activities, we've introduced a custom fields setting where you can enter comma-separated (no spaces, etc.) custom fields to sync by their REST API name.

By default, we only sync the following fields on the leads collection:

- id
- email
- firstName
- lastName
- createdAt
- updatedAt

You can find a full list of standard fields and their REST API names [here](http://developers.marketo.com/rest-api/lead-database/fields/list-of-standard-fields/). If there are other fields you're interested in, [contact support](https://segment.com/help/contact/)  for assistance.
