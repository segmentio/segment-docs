[Mailmodo](https://www.mailmodo.com){:target="_blank”} is an email marketing platform that helps you create interactive emails powered by AMP. With our no-code editor, you can create an interactive email in minutes and send engaging and personalized emails that boost conversions.

This source is maintained by Mailmodo. For any issues with the source, [contact their Support team](mailto:support@mailmodo.com){:target="_blank”}.


## Getting Started

#### Step 1: Add a new Mailmodo Source to Segment
1. From your workspace’s [Sources catalog page](https://app.segment.com/goto-my-workspace/sources/catalog) click **Add Source**.
2. Search for “Mailmodo” in the Sources Catalog, select Mailmodo, and click **Add Source**.
3. On the next screen, give the Source a nickname and configure any other settings. The nickname is used as a label in the Segment app, and Segment creates a related schema name in your warehouse. The nickname can be anything, but we recommend using something that reflects the source itself and distinguishes it amongst your environments (for example, Mailmodo_Campaigns).

5. Click **Add Source** to save your settings.
6. Copy the write key from the Segment UI. You will need to input this key on the Mailmodo integration page.

#### Step 2: Enter connection details on Mailmodo
1. Look for the Segment Source option on the Mailmodo Integration page. Select **Click to configure**.
2. Enter your Write Key copied from your Segment source and select a Segment Region.
3. Click **Test and Save** to complete the setup. 
4. If the provided write key is valid, Mailmodo will now act as a Segment source. To verify your setup, you can check Segment's [Source Debugger](/docs/connections/sources/debugger/) to see if any events arrived. 

#### Step 3: Connect destinations to your Mailmodo Source
Now that your Source is set up, you can connect it to Destinations.


Log in to your downstream tools and make sure that the events are populating in your Debugger and that they contain all of the properties you expect. If something isn’t working as you expect, see the Destination docs for troubleshooting.


If there are problems with how the events arrive at Segment, [contact the Mailmodo Support team](mailto:support@mailmodo.com){:target="_blank”}.

The following table lists events that Mailmodo sends to Segment. These events show up as tables in your Warehouse and as regular events in your other Destinations. Mailmodo will send campaign activity data only for those contacts for whom we have received identify calls previously from Segment.
