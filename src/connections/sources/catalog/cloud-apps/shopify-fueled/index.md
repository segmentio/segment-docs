[Fueled](https://fueled.io){:target="_blank"} is a 1st-party event collector, designed specifically for eCommerce. Fueled captures the first-party and zero-party events that fire on a Shopify website, and sends them to various destinations - most notably, Segment. Fueled leverages a combination of client-side and server-side event collection technologies to provide reliable, accurate event tracking. In addition to tracking website events in the browser, Fueled tracks offline purchase events, such as point-of-sale orders and subscription rebilling events triggered by Shopify apps like ReCharge Payments, Smartrr, Bold Subscriptions, and Skio.

With Fueled, Shopify merchants can implement Segment event tracking in minutes — without writing any code.

**Shopify merchants can try Fueled's Segment integration free for 15 days.**

This integration is maintained by [Fueled](https://fueled.io){:target="_blank"}. [Contact the Fueled Support team](mailto:support@fueled.io) with any questions.

## Getting started

Installing Fueled's Shopify Source integration for Segment is a two-step process where you need to:
1. [Add the **Shopify - Powered by Fueled** source in Segment](#adding-the-shopify---powered-by-fueled-source-in-segment).
2. [Enable the **Fueled Attribution Suite** in Shopify](#enable-the-fueled-attribution-suite-in-shopify). 

### Add the "Shopify - Powered by Fueled" source in Segment

1. From your workspace's [Sources catalog page](https://app.segment.com/goto-my-workspace/sources/catalog){:target="_blank”} click **Add Source**.
2. Find *Shopify - Powered by Fueled* in the source Catalog, and click **Add Source**.
3. Give your Shopify Source a name and click **Save**.
4. Copy the **Write key** from the Segment UI.

### Enable the *Fueled Attribution Suite* in Shopify

1. **Log in** to your Shopify Store account.
2. Go to the [Shopify app store listing](https://apps.shopify.com/fueled-attribution-suite){:target="_blank”} for ***Fueled Attribution Suite***.
3. Click **Add app** to install the Fueled Attribution Suite.
4. Within the Fueled App in the Shopify Admin UI, click the **Plans** tab and choose the **Fueled Advanced Plan**.
5. Once you confirmed your Fueled Advanced Plan, go to the **Segment** tab.
6. Add the Segment write key for the Segment source that is going to send data in the **Segment Write key** field form.
7. Configure client-side and server-side tracking settings in the **Tracking Setup** tab.

## Stream

Fueled's Shopify source streams events into Segment. It uses server-side methods to send `track`, `identify`, and `page` events to Segment. These events are then available in any Segment destination that accepts server-side events, and are available in a schema in your data warehouse so you can query using SQL.

The default behavior is for Fueled to pass the email address of identified users as the Segment `userId` , when it's available.

## Events

The table below lists events that Fueled's Shopify Source automatically sends to Segment. These events appear as tables in your warehouse, and as regular events in other destinations. Fueled's Shopify Source includes the `userId` (the customer's email address) if available.

Fueled's Shopify Source also supports *custom events* captured client-side by Fueled's javascript library and sent to Segment. To learn more about sending custom events to Segment, visit this [Learning Center article](https://learn.fueled.io/apps/shopify/shopify-event-tracking/customizing-client-side-shopify-events){:target="_blank”}.

## Add destinations

Now that your Shopify Source is set up, you can connect it with destinations.

Log in to your downstream tools and check to see that your events appear as expected, and that they contain all of the properties you expect. If your events and properties don’t appear, check the [Event Delivery](/docs/connections/event-delivery/) tool, and refer to the destination docs for each tool for troubleshooting.

If there are any issues with how the events arrive to Segment, [contact the Fueled support team](mailto:support@fueled.io).
