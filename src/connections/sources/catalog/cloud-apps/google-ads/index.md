[Google Ads](https://ads.google.com/home/){:target="_blank"} is an online advertising service developed by Google. With Google Ads, you can take advantage of online advertising to improve your internet marketing effectiveness.

> info "Google Ads Source API Upgrade"
> In April 2022, Segment upgraded from using the Google AdWords API to the Google Ads API for the Segment Google Ads source. As a result of this change, Segment [no longer supports](https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/docs/reporting/zero-metrics#rows_returned){:target="_blank"} "Include Zero Impressions." Queries that contain segments (date, product, country, etc.) will no longer return data for rows that have zero metrics. Because all collections reported to Segment contain date segments in their queries, Include Zero Impressions is no longer supported for any collection in the Google Ads source.
> <br/>In addition, some properties in the following collections have different functionality: 
> - [Ad Performance Report](#ad-performance-report)
> - [Campaign Performance Report](#campaign-performance-report)
> - [Click Performance Report](#click-performance-report)
> - [Search Performance Report](#search-performance-report)
> - [Keyword Performance Report](#keyword-performance-report)

## Getting Started

1. From your workspace's `/sources` page, click `Add Source`.

2. Choose Google Ads and click `Connect`.

3. Click `Authenticate Google Ads` and go through the authentication flow.

4. Select a Google Ads account to sync and click `Next`

5. Choose a schema name. This will be the namespace you will be querying against in your warehouse. Segment recommends that you choose a name that reflects the source itself, like `google_ads`, or `google_ads_usa`.

### Permissions

When you set up your Google Ads Source, you may notice that all the Google Ads accounts your Google user can view aren't listed. This is because the Google Ads API doesn't expose a list of "managed" or sub-accounts to non-administrators using the API. That said, if you have read permissions to the account and would like to add it, please [contact Support](https://segment.com/help/contact){:target="_blank"}. For more information about finding your Google Ads Customer ID, see [here](https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/1704344?co=ADWORDS.IsAWNCustomer%3Dfalse&hl=en){:target="_blank"}.

### What Google Ads MCC do you sync?
By default, the primary Google Ads account connected to your Google account syncs to Segment. If you would like to override this, please [contact Support](https://segment.com/help/contact){:target="_blank"}.

### I'm getting an Internal Server Error!

If you're getting the error pictured below, try disabling any ad block extensions in your browser and attempting again.

## Sync Component

The Google Ads source contains a sync component. This enables Segment to the Google Ads API on your behalf on a 3 hour interval to pull the latest data into Segment. In the initial sync, Segment retrieves the Google Ads objects (and corresponding properties) according to the Collections Table below. The objects write into a separate schema, corresponding to the name of the  source instance's schema you designated during configuration. For example, chose `google-ads` as the schema, the `ads` collection is accessible at `google-ads.ads` in SQL.

The sync component uses an upsert API, so the data in your warehouse loaded using sync will reflect the latest state of the corresponding resource in Google Ads.  For example, if `budget` from `0` to `100` between syncs, on its next sync that tickets status will be `100`.

The source syncs and warehouse syncs are independent processes. Source syncs pull your data into the Segment Hub, and warehouse syncs flush that data to your warehouse. Sources sync with Segment every 3 hours. Depending on your Warehouses plan, Segment pushes the Source data to your warehouse on the interval associated with your billing plan.


## Collections

Collections are the groupings of resources Segment pulls from your source. In your warehouse, each collection has its own table.
