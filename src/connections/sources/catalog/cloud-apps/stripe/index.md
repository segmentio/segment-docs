[Stripe](https://stripe.com/about){:target="_blank”} builds economic infrastructure for the internet, that enables businesses of every size to accept payments and manage their businesses online.


## Getting Started
1. In Segment go to **Connections** and click **Add Source**.
2. Choose Stripe.
3. Give the Source a nickname and click **Add Source**. The nickname is used to designate the source in the Segment interface, and Segment creates a related schema name. The schema name is the namespace you query against in your warehouse. The nickname can be whatever you like, but Segment recommends using a name that reflects the source itself and distinguishes amongst your environments.
4. Click **Connect**, and authenticate with Stripe's OAuth. To use data from Stripe's test mode, [contact Segment Support](https://segment.com/help/contact/){:target="_blank"} with your test Secret Key. Segment's support team can then configure your source to use test mode data.

## Components

### Sync

The Stripe source is built with a sync component, which means Segment make requests to the Stripe API on your behalf on a three hour interval to pull the latest data into Segment. In the initial sync, Segment grabs all the Stripe objects (and their corresponding properties) according to the Collections Table below. The objects are written into a separate schema, corresponding to the source instance's schema name you designated upon creation (for example, `stripe_prod.charges`).

Segment's sync component uses an upsert API, so the data in your warehouse loaded using sync reflects the latest state of the corresponding resource in Stripe. For example, if `subscription_status` goes from `active` to `inactive` between syncs, on its next sync that ticket's status is `inactive`.

The source syncs and warehouse syncs are independent processes. Source runs pull your data into the Segment Hub, and warehouse runs flush that data to your warehouse. Sources will sync with Segment every three hours. Depending on your Warehouses plan, Segment pushes the Source data to your warehouse on the interval associated with your billing plan.

## Collections
Collections are the groupings of resources that Segment pulls from your source. In your warehouse, each collection gets its own table.
