Salesforce is a leader in on-demand customer relationship management. [Visit Website](http://salesforce.com)

Take your company's analysis to the next level by **adding Salesforce as a Source to Segment.** We'll automatically collect objects like `Accounts`, `Campaigns`, and `Tasks` and load them into your data warehouse.Â 

This document was last updated on April 26, 2018. If you notice any gaps, outdated information or simply want to leave some feedback to help us improve our documentation, [let us know](https://segment.com/help/contact)!

## Getting Started

1. From your workspace's `/sources` page, click `add source`.

2. Choose Salesforce.

3. Give your source a name.

4. Connect Segment to your Salesforce environment and authorize Segment to connect to it. In order for Segment to collect and sync your Salesforce data, you must enable API access for the user that you are connecting to Segment with. For more information on how to confirm or change API access for a Salesforce user, follow Salesforce's [recommended documentation](https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=admin_userperms.htm).

5. Choose a data warehouse to connect Salesforce to.

6. In your Salesforce source settings you can customize the source  nickname and  schema name. The nickname is a label used in the Segment interface, and the schema name is the namespace you query against in your warehouse. Both can be whatever you like, but we recommend sticking to something that reflects the source itself, like `Salesforce` for nickname and `sfdc`, `salesforce`, or `sfdc_prod` for the schema name.

  **Note:** that you can add multiple instances if you have multiple SalesForce accounts. That's why we allow you to customize the source's nickname and schema name!


## Components

### Sync

The Salesforce source is built with a sync component, which means we'll make requests to their API on your behalf on a 3 hour interval to pull the latest data into Segment. In the initial sync, we'll grab all the Salesforce objects (and their corresponding properties) according to the Collections Table below. The objects will be written into a separate schema, corresponding to the source instance's schema name you designated upon creation. For example, if you went with `sfdc_prod`, the `leads` collection will be accessible at `sfdc_prod.leads` in SQL.

Our sync component uses an upsert API, so the data in your warehouse loaded using sync will reflect the latest state of the corresponding resource in Salesforce. For example, if `ticket_status` goes from `open` to `closed` between syncs, on its next sync that tickets status will be `closed`.

The source syncs and warehouse syncs are independent processes. Source runs pull your data into the Segment Hub, and warehouse runs flush that data to your warehouse. Sources will sync with Segment every 3 hours. Depending on your Warehouses plan, we will push the Source data to your warehouse on the interval associated with your billing plan.

## Collections

### Custom Objects

If you'd like to sync any SFDC custom objects, just [contact us]https://segment.com/help/contact/ and we'll get it set up. Include the [API names](https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=000007594&language=en_US&type=1) of the custom objects. We'll add support for this to the UI soon!

### Deleting Records

Segment supports the use of soft deletes in Salesforce. If you perform a soft delete on a record in Salesforce, your next one to two warehouses syncs will change the value of `is_deleted` for the assoicated record to `True`.

At this time, we do not support hard deletes in Salesforce. Use of hard deletes will result in the data remaining in the warehouse with `is_deleted` set to `False`.

## Collection Properties

Segment performs a one-to-one mapping of all publicly available fields (standard and custom) from Salesforce. To see the full list of the standard fields refer to the Saleforce field documentation linked in each collection above. If you've added custom fields to an existing collection, [contact us]https://segment.com/help/contact/ and we'll get those set up to sync. You do not need to include the field names.

## Adding Destinations
Currently, Warehouses are the only supported destination for object-cloud sources.
