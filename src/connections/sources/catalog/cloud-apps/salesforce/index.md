[Salesforce](http://salesforce.com){:target="_blank"} is a leader in on-demand customer relationship management.

Take your company's analysis to the next level by **adding Salesforce as a Source to Segment.** Segment automatically collects objects like `Accounts`, `Campaigns`, and `Tasks` and loads them into your data warehouse. 

## Getting Started
> info ""
> You can add multiple instances of this source if you have more than one Salesforce account. 

1. From your workspace's `/sources` page, click `Add Source`.

2. Choose Salesforce.

3. Give the source a name, add labels, if applicable, and select the Salesforce environment you'd like to pull data from. To use data from a Salesforce sandbox environment, select **Sandbox** from the Salesforce Environment dropdown and [contact Segment Support](https://segment.com/help/contact/). Our Support team will then configure your source to use sandbox data.

4. Connect Segment to your Salesforce environment and authorize Segment to connect to it. In order for Segment to collect and sync your Salesforce data, you must enable API access for the user that you are connecting to Segment with. For more information on how to confirm or change API access for a Salesforce user, follow Salesforce's [recommended documentation](https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=admin_userperms.htm){:target="_blank"}.   

5. Choose a data warehouse to connect Salesforce to.

6. In the Salesforce source settings you can customize the source nickname and schema name. The nickname is a label used in the Segment interface, and the schema name is the namespace you query against in your warehouse. Both can be whatever you like, but Segment recommends that you use something that reflects the source itself, like `Salesforce` for nickname and `sfdc`, `salesforce`, or `sfdc_prod` for the schema name. Configure Selective Sync to retrieve only specific objects and properties from Salesforce.

## Components

### Sync

The Salesforce source contains a sync component, which means Segment makes requests to the Salesforce API on your behalf on a 3 hour interval to pull the latest data into Segment. In the initial sync, by default Segment downloads all the Salesforce objects (and their corresponding properties) according to the Collections Table below. Segment writes the objects into a separate schema, that corresponds to the source instance's schema name you designated upon creation. For example, you name the schema `sfdc_prod`, the `leads` collection is accessible at `sfdc_prod.leads` in SQL.

If you configure Selective Sync, Segment only retrieves the objects and properties you specify. Use Selective Sync to avoid unnecessary Salesforce API consumption.

> info "A note about Selective Sync"
> The Salesforce Selective Sync feature is separate from the [Segment Warehouse Selective Sync](/docs/connections/storage/warehouses/warehouse-syncs/#warehouse-selective-sync). Both features enable you to choose what to sync. The Salesforce Selective Sync impacts the information that Segment collects from Salesforce.

Our sync component uses an upsert API, so the data in your warehouse loaded using sync will reflect the latest state of the corresponding resource in Salesforce. For example, if `ticket_status` goes from `open` to `closed` between syncs, on its next sync that tickets status will be `closed`.

The source syncs and warehouse syncs are independent processes. Source runs pull your data into the Segment Hub, and warehouse runs flush that data to your warehouse. Sources will sync with Segment every 3 hours. Depending on your Warehouses plan, we will push the Source data to your warehouse on the interval associated with your billing plan.

## Collections

Collections are the groupings of resources we pull from your source. In your warehouse, each collection gets its own table.

### Custom Objects

Business tier customers can select and add custom objects from the Selective Sync page in the Salesforce source settings. 

Self service customers, please contact us with the [API names](https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=000007594&language=en_US&type=1) of the custom objects you want to add.


### Deleting Records

Segment supports the use of soft deletes in Salesforce. If you perform a soft delete on a record in Salesforce, your next one to two warehouses syncs will change the value of `is_deleted` for the associated record to `True`.

Segment does not support hard deletes in Salesforce. Use of hard deletes will result in the data remaining in the warehouse with `is_deleted` set to `False`.

## Collection Properties

Segment performs a one-to-one mapping of all publicly available fields (standard and custom) from Salesforce. To see the full list of the standard fields refer to the Salesforce field documentation linked in each collection above. If you've added custom fields to an existing collection, [contact us](https://segment.com/help/contact/) and we'll get those set up to sync. You do not need to include the field names.

## Adding Destinations

Warehouses are the only supported destination for object-cloud sources.

## Troubleshooting

If you are syncing data from a Salesforce sandbox environment and see an "Invalid credentials" error, [contact our support team](https://segment.com/help/contact/), who will configure your Segment source to use sandbox data.
