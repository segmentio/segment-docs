[Regal Voice](https://regalvoice.com/?utm_source=segmentio&utm_medium=docs&utm_campaign=partners) is a next-gen customer engagement platform built for B2C services brands to proactively reach out to customers on voice and sms before they buy elsewhere.

> **Good to know**: This page is about the Regal Voice Segment source, which sends data _into_ Segment. There's also a page about the [Regal Voice Segment destination](/docs/connections/destinations/catalog/regal-voice/), which receives data from Segment!

## Getting Started

1. From your workspace's [Sources catalog page](https://app.segment.com/goto-my-workspace/sources/catalog) click **Add Source**.
2. Search for "Regal Voice" in the Sources Catalog, select click Regal Voice, and click **Add Source**.
3. On the next screen, give the Source a nickname and configure any other settings.

   The nickname is used as a label in the Segment app, and Segment creates a related schema name in your warehouse.  The nickname can be anything, but we recommend using something that reflects the source itself and distinguishes amongst your environments (eg. SourceName_Prod, SourceName_Staging, SourceName_Dev).
5. Click **Add Source** to save your settings.
6. Copy the Write key from the Segment UI and email it to support@regalvoice.com.

## Events

The table below lists events that Regal Voice sends to Segment. These events appear as tables in your warehouse and as regular events in other Destinations. Regal Voice includes the `userId` if available.

## Adding Destinations

Now that your Source is set up, you can connect it with Destinations.

Log into your downstream tools and check to see that your events appear as expected, and that they contain all of the properties you expect. If your events and properties don't appear, check the [Event Delivery](https://segment.com/docs/connections/event-delivery/) tool, and refer to the Destination docs for each tool for troubleshooting.

If there are any issues with how the events are arriving to Segment, [contact the Regal Voice support team](mailto:support@regalvoice.com).
