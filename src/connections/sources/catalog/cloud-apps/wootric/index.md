[InMoment](https://wootric.com/?utm_source=segmentio&utm_medium=docs&utm_campaign=partners) (formerly Wootric) is modern customer feedback management software. You can incorporate Voice of Customer data in your decision-making processes and marketing campaigns, and trigger customer follow-up when you send survey responses to your CRM, marketing platform or data warehouses automatically.

InMoment maintains this source. For any issues, [contact the InMoment support team](mailto:support@wootric.com).

## Getting Started

1. In Segment go to **Connections** and click **Add Source**.
2. Search for **InMoment** in the Source Catalog and confirm by clicking **Connect**.
3. Give the Source a nickname and click **Add Source**. The nickname is used to designate the source in the Segment interface, and Segment creates a related schema name. The schema name is the namespace you query against in your warehouse. The nickname can be whatever you like, but Segment recommends using a name that reflects the source itself and distinguishes amongst your environments (eg. SourceName_Prod, SourceName_Staging, SourceName_Dev).
4. Go to the **Settings > API Keys**. 
5. Copy the **Write Key** and log in to your InMoment account. 
6. Navigate to **Settings > Integrations > Send InMoment Data > Send survey responses back to Segment** and paste the write key to connect.

## Events

## Adding Destinations

Now that your Source is set up, you can connect it with Destinations.

Log into your downstream tools and check to see that your events are populating and they contain all the properties you expect. If all your events and properties are not showing up, refer to the Destination docs for troubleshooting.

If you experience any issues with how the events arrive in Segment, [contact the InMoment team](mailto:support@wootric.com).
