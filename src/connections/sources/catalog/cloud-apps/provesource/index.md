## Getting Started

1. From your Segment UI's Sources page click on "Add Source".
2. Search for "ProveSource" within the Sources Catalog and confirm by clicking "Connect".
3. Give the Source a nickname and follow the set up flow to "Add Source". The nickname will be used to designate the source in the Segment interface, and Segment will create a related schema name. The schema name is the namespace you'll be querying against in your warehouse. The nickname can be whatever you like, but we recommend sticking to something that reflects the source itself and distinguishes amongst your environments (eg. SourceName_Prod, SourceName_Staging, SourceName_Dev).
4. Copy the Write key from the Segment UI and log in to your ProveSource account - navigate to [Settings](https://console.provesrc.com/#/settings) > Integrations > Click Edit next to Segment Integration and paste the key to connect.

## Adding Destinations

Now that your Source is set up, you can connect it with Destinations.

Log into your downstream tools and check to see that your events are populating and they contains all the properties you expect. If all your events and properties are not showing up, refer to the Destination docs for troubleshooting.

If you experience any issues with how the events arrive in Segment, [contact the ProveSource team](mailto:support@provesrc.com).
