[HEROW](https://www.herow.io) is a contextual platform for mobile application. Built around everyday behaviors and powered by location intelligence, its one-stop solution allows apps to maximize mobile engagement with their users.

This is an [Enrichment Source](https://segment.com/docs/sources/#event-cloud-sources) which can not only export data into your Segment warehouse, but they can also federate the exported data into your other enabled Segment Destinations.

This source is maintained by HEROW. For any issues with the source, [contact their team](mailto:support@herow.io).

_**NOTE:** The HEROW Source is currently in beta, which means that they are still actively developing the source. This doc was last updated on January 29, 2020. If you are interested in joining their beta program or have any feedback to help improve the HEROW Source and its documentation, [let their team know](mailto:support@HEROW.io)!_


## Getting Started

1. From your Segment UI’s Sources page click on “Add Source”.
2. Search for "HEROW" within the Sources Catalog and confirm by clicking "Connect".
3. Give the Source a nickname and follow the set up flow to "Add Source". The nickname will be used to designate the source in the Segment interface, and Segment will create a related schema name. The schema name is the namespace you'll be querying against in your warehouse. The nickname can be whatever you like, but we recommend sticking to something that reflects the source itself and distinguishes amongst your environments (eg. HEROW_Prod, HEROW_Staging, HEROW_Dev).
4. Copy the Write key from the Segment UI and log in to your HEROW account - navigate to Settings > Integrations > Segment Integration and paste the key to connect.

## Events

Below is a table of events that HEROW sends to Segment. These events will show up as tables in your warehouse, and as regular events in your other Destinations.

## Adding Destinations

Now that your Source is set up, you can connect it with Destinations.

Log into your downstream tools and check to see that your events are populating and they contains all the properties you expect. If all your events and properties are not showing up, refer to the Destination docs for troubleshooting.

If you experience any issues with how the events arrive in Segment, [contact the HEROW team](mailto:support@HEROW.io).
