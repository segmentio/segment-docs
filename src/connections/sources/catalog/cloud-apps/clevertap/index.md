[CleverTap](https://clevertap.com/){:target="_blank”} is the all-in-one customer engagement platform that helps brands personalize and optimize all consumer touch points to improve user engagement, retention, and lifetime value.

Using CleverTap as a source on Segment, you can evolve your team's engagement and marketing efforts. With CleverTap Exports, you can automatically send your users' engagement and activity events to Segment and forward them to your destinations or warehouses.

Segment allows you to seamlessly move CleverTap data to your favorite BI or analytics tool to combine CleverTap data with the event data already flowing into Segment. This helps you get a holistic report of your engagement and marketing efforts.

This is an [Event Cloud Source](/docs/sources/#event-cloud-sources) which can export data into your Segment warehouse and federate the exported data into your enabled Segment destinations.

This source is maintained by CleverTap. For any issues with the source, [contact their Support team](https://help.clevertap.com/hc/en-us/requests/new){:target="_blank”}.

> info "This is a Beta source"
> The CleverTap Source is in beta, which means that they are still actively developing the source. If you're interested in joining their beta program or have any feedback to help improve the CleverTap Source and its documentation, [let their team know](https://help.clevertap.com/hc/en-us/requests/new)._

## Getting Started

1. From your workspace's [Sources catalog page](https://app.segment.com/goto-my-workspace/sources/catalog) click **Add Source**.
2. Search for "CleverTap" in the Sources Catalog, select CleverTap, and click **Add Source**.
3. On the next screen, give the Source a nickname and configure any other applicable settings.
    - The nickname is used as a label in the Segment app, and Segment creates a related schema name in your warehouse. The nickname can be anything, but Segment recommends using something that reflects the source itself and distinguishes amongst your environments (like `CleverTap_Prod`, `CleverTap_Staging`, or `CleverTap_Dev`).
4. Click **Add Source** to save your settings.
5. Copy the write key from the Segment UI. You will need to input this key on the CleverTap > Partners Page.
6. Once you have the CleverTap Source's Write Key, go to CleverTap Dashboard > Settings > Partners. Search for Segment, and a click "Add Integration". 
7. Give your connection a name, enter your write key, select a Segment Region, and choose a User Identity.
    - **Note:** Cross-region data is not allowed. Your events will be dropped by Segment if the region you select in CleverTap is different from your Segment Workspace Region.
8. Go back to Segment and navigate to your CleverTap source. Click **Add Destinations** to add any destinations that you want to receive CleverTap data.

If your events and properties don’t appear as expected, check the [Event Delivery](/docs/connections/event-delivery/) tool and refer to the docs for each destination.
