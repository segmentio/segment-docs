[Gladly](https://www.gladly.com/){:target="_blank"} is the only platform purposely built to help the world's fastest growing brands deliver radically personal customer service. Designed around people and not tickets, Gladly's all-in-one platform features every channel - from voice to SMS - natively built into a single UI, allowing agents to communicate seamlessly across all channels. Rated the #1 easiest-to-use customer service platform, Gladly is empowering brands of all sizes to deliver and scale exceptional customer and agent experiences and build brand loyalty.

The Gladly Source is an [Event Cloud Source](/docs/sources#event-cloud-sources) that can be used to track when your customers open or closed a conversation with an agent. Not only can you export data into your Segment warehouse, but you can also send the exported data into your other enabled Segment Destinations.

This source is maintained by Gladly. For any issues with the source, [contact the Gladly Support team](mailto:support@gladly.com).

## Add Destinations

Now that your Source is set up, you can connect it with Destinations.

Log into your downstream tools and check to see that your events appear as expected, and that they contain all of the properties you expect. If your events and properties donâ€™t appear, check the [Event Delivery](https://segment.com/docs/connections/event-delivery/) tool, and refer to the Destination docs for each tool for troubleshooting.

If there are any issues with how the events are arriving to Segment, [contact the Gladly support team](mailto:support@gladly.com).
