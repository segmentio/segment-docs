[Desk.com](http://www.desk.com/), previously known as Assistly, is a SaaS help desk and customer support product owned by Salesforce.com and accessible through the cloud.

Desk.com is specifically implemented to targets small businesses with its features and functions. This tool can help you combining your support data with website activity and product usage data, as well as analyzing it using your favorite business intelligence and SQL querying tools.


## Getting Started

### Add a new Desk.com source

3. Choose Desk.com.
4. Choose a name for your Desk.com source to identify it within your workspace.

6. Add a warehouse or connect Intercom to an already existing warehouse in your workspace

## Components

The Desk.com source is built with a sync component, which means we'll make requests to their API on your behalf on a 3 hour interval to pull the latest data into Segment. In the initial sync, we'll grab all the Desk.com objects (and their corresponding properties) according to the Collections Table below. The objects will be written into a separate schema, corresponding to the source instance's schema name you designated upon creation (ie. `desk_com.cases`).

Our sync component uses an upsert API, so the data in your warehouse loaded via sync will reflect the latest state of the corresponding resource in Desk.com. For example, if `priority` goes from `2` to `4` between syncs, on its next sync that priority value will be `4`.

The source syncs and warehouse syncs are independent processes. Source runs pull your data into the Segment Hub, and warehouse runs flush that data to your warehouse. Sources will sync with Segment every 3 hours. Depending on your Warehouses plan, we will push the Source data to your warehouse on the interval associated with your billing plan.
