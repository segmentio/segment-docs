Littledata is a smart analytics app that automates ecommerce tracking. Littledata's [Shopify-to-Segment connection](https://www.littledata.io/connections/segment/?utm_source=segmentio&utm_medium=docs&utm_campaign=partners) automatically tracks key ecommerce events on a Shopify or Shopify Plus store, so you can use Shopify as a source in your Segment workspace.

Littledata uses a smart tracking script that can be applied to any Shopify site. The app uses server-side tracking to ensure 100% accuracy, gathering data at every customer touch point.

This integration is maintained by Littledata. Please [reach out to their team](mailto:support@littledata.io) with any questions.
