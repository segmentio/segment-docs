[Zendesk](https://www.zendesk.com/) is a customer service platform for enterprises, which provides a customer support platform that allows quicker and easier interaction between businesses and customers.


## Getting Started

1. Go to **Connections > Sources** and click **Add Source** in the Segment app.

2. Search for **Zendesk** in the Sources Catalog and click **Add Source**.

3. Give the Source a name and add any labels to help you organize and filter your sources. You can give the source any name, but Segment recommends a name that reflects the source itself, as this name auto-populates the schema name. For example, the source name `Zendesk` creates the schema `zendesk`.

   * **Note**: You can add multiple instances if you have multiple Zendesk accounts. That's why Segment allows you to customize the source's nickname and schema name.

4. Enter your Zendesk subdomain. The subdomain you use to access your Zendesk portal (for example 'segment' for segment.zendesk.com)

   * **Note:** If you enter `segment.zendesk.com` as a subdomain instead of just `segment`, Segment tries to access the host `segment.zendesk.com.zendesk.com` and you will get a credentials error.

5. Click **Authorize** to start Zendesk's OAuth process. Sign in and grant permissions, you'll be good to go.

> **Tip**: Segment uses the incremental export API from Zendesk, which requires Admin access. Make sure the user has Admin authorizations.


### Rate Limits

The Zendesk source uses both Zendesk's [Core API](https://developer.zendesk.com/api-reference/){:target="_blank"} and [Incremental Exports API](https://developer.zendesk.com/rest_api/docs/core/incremental_export){:target="_blank"}. The source's requests to the Incremental API don't count towards your Zendesk account's rate limits, but requests to the Core API do. By default, Segment caps requests to Zendesk's Core API to a rate of 200 requests per minute to avoid triggering [Zendesk's Rate Limits](https://developer.zendesk.com/api-reference/ticketing/account-configuration/usage_limits/){:target="_blank"}. If you'd like to increase or decrease the request rate for your source, [please reach out](https://segment.com/help/contact/). Support for this in the UI is in the works.

## Components

### Sync

The Zendesk source is built with a sync component, which means Segment makes requests to their API on your behalf on a three hour interval to pull the latest data into Segment. In the initial sync, Segment grabs all the Zendesk objects (and their corresponding properties) according to the Collections Table below. The objects are written into a separate schema, corresponding to the source instance's schema name you designated upon creation (like `zendesk_prod.users`).

The sync component uses an upsert API, so the data in your warehouse loaded using sync reflects the latest state of the corresponding resource in Zendesk.  For example, if `ticket_status` goes from `open` to `closed` between syncs, on its next sync that tickets status is `closed`.

The source syncs and warehouse syncs are independent processes. Source runs pull your data into the Segment Hub, and warehouse runs flush that data to your warehouse. Sources sync with Segment every three hours. Depending on your Warehouses plan, Segment pushes the Source data to your warehouse on the interval associated with your billing plan.

At the moment, Segment doesn't support filtering which objects or properties get synced. If you're interested in this feature, [please reach out](https://segment.com/help/contact/).

## Collections

Collections are the groupings of resources Segment pulls from your source.


|  Collection | Type | Description |
|  ------ | ------ | ------ |
|  [users](#users) | object | Zendesk Support has three types of users: end-users (your customers), agents, and administrators. End-users request support through tickets. Agents work in Zendesk Support to solve tickets. Agents can be divided into multiple groups and can also belong to multiple groups. Agents don't have access to administrative configuration in Zendesk Support such as business rules or automation, but can configure their own macros and views. Administrators have all the abilities of agents, plus administrative abilities. |
|  [groups](#groups) | object | When support requests arrive in Zendesk, they can be assigned to a Group. Groups serve as the core element of ticket workflow; support agents are organized into Groups and tickets can be assigned to a Group only, or to an assigned agent within a Group. A ticket can never be assigned to an agent without also being assigned to a Group. |
|  [tickets](#tickets) | object | Tickets are the means through which your End-users (customers) communicate with Agents in Zendesk. **Note**: Segment pulls all tickets updated (or created) in the last year to start by default. If you need more, reach out to Segment support. Support can do a run to pull further back in history.  |
|  [ticket_fields](#ticket_fields) | object | Customize fields on the ticket form.  |
|  [activities](#activities) | object | The activity stream is a per agent event stream. It will give access to the most recent events that relate to the agent polling the API. |
|  [attachments](#activities) | object | This API is for attachments in tickets and forum posts in the Web portal. |
|  [organizations](#organizations) | object | Just as agents can be segmented into groups in Zendesk, your customers (end-users) can be segmented into organizations. |
|  [ticket_events](#ticket_events) | events | Returns a stream of changes that occurred on tickets. Each event is tied to an update on a ticket and contains all the fields that were updated in that change. **Note**: Segment pulls one year of ticket events to start by default. If you need more, reach out to [Segment support](https://segment.com/help/contact/). Support can do a run to pull further back in history. |
|  [ticket_metrics](#ticket_metrics) | object | All kinds of aggregate metrics about a ticket |
|  [satisfaction_ratings](#satisfaction_ratings) | object | If you have enabled satisfaction ratings for your account, this end point allows you to quickly retrieve all ratings. |
|  [ticket_comments](#ticket_comments) | object | Ticket comments represent the conversation between requesters, collaborators, and agents. It includes the full body of each comment, public and private. **Note**: This collection is not included by default. To request it, [contact Segment support](https://segment.com/help/contact/). |
|  [ticket_forms](#ticket_forms) | object | Ticket forms allow an admin to define a subset of ticket fields for display to both agents and end users. **Note**: This feature requires a Zendesk Enterprise account. |
|  [ticket_skips](#ticket_skips) | object | A skip is a record of when an agent skips over a ticket without responding to the end user.  |
|  [organization_memberships](#organization_memberships) | object | An organization_membership links a user to an organization. Organizations can have many users. Users can be in many organizations if the account supports multiple organizations. |
|  [group_memberships](#group_memberships) | object | A group_membership links an agent to a group. Groups can have many agents, as agents can be in many groups. |
|  [audit_logs](#audit_logs) | object | The audit log shows various changes in your instance of Zendesk since the account was created.  **Note**: This collection is not included by default. To request it, [contact Segment support](https://segment.com/help/contact/). |


In your warehouse, each collection gets its own table. Find below a list of the properties Segment automatically fetches for each collection.

> note "Standard properties"
> The list in this document includes the standard properties only, but doesn't include _your_ custom fields. (Don't worry, they'll be there in your warehouse.)
