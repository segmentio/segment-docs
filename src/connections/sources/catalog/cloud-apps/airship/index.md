title: Airship Source
---

[Airship](https://www.airship.com) gives brands the data, channels, orchestration and services they need to deliver push notifications, emails, SMS, in-app messages, and more to the right person in the right moment â€” building trust, boosting engagement, driving action and growing value.

Real-Time Data Stream automatically collects user-level data and sends the data to Segment for analysis or action through other Destination integrations. At Airship, we understand that seamlessly tying data across platforms can be a complex task. This integration removes the development so users can get back to understanding their audience and reaching them on their preferred channel.

This Source integration is maintained by Airship. For any issues with the source, [contact the Airship Support team](mailto:partner-integration-ua@airship.com).

> **Good to know**: This page is about the Airship Segment source, which sends data _into_ Segment. There's also a page about the [Airship Segment destination](/docs/connections/destinations/catalog/airship/), which receives data from Segment!

## Getting Started

1. From your Segment UI's Sources page click on "Add Source".
2. Search for Airship within the Sources Catalog and confirm by clicking "Connect".
3. Give the Source a nickname and follow the set up flow to "Add Source". The nickname will be used to designate the source in the Segment interface, and Segment will create a related schema name. The schema name is the namespace you'll be querying against in your warehouse. The nickname can be whatever you like, but we recommend sticking to something that reflects the source itself and distinguishes amongst your environments (eg. SourceName_Prod, SourceName_Staging, SourceName_Dev).
4. Copy the Write key from the Segment UI and log in to your Airship account - navigate to Settings > Real-Time Data Stream > Segment and follow the steps for configuration.


## Events

Below is a table of events that Airship sends to Segment. These events will show up as tables in your warehouse, and as regular events in your other Destinations. Airship will send through the `userId` if available.

## Adding Destinations

Now that your Source is set up, you can connect it with Destinations.

Log into your downstream tools and check to see that your events are populating and they contains all the properties you expect. If all your events and properties are not showing up, refer to the Destination docs for troubleshooting.

For any issues with the Source events, [contact the Airship team](mailto:partner-integration-ua@airship.com).
