> **Good to know**: This page is about the Selligent Marketing Cloud Segment source, which sends data _into_ Segment. There's also a page about the [Selligent Marketing Cloud Segment destination](/docs/connections/destinations/catalog/selligent-marketing-cloud/), which receives data from Segment!

## Getting Started

1. From your workspace's [Sources catalog page](https://app.segment.com/goto-my-workspace/sources/catalog) click **Add Source**.
2. Search for "Selligent Marketing Cloud" in the Sources Catalog, select click Selligent Marketing Cloud, and click **Add Source**.
3. On the next screen, give the Source a nickname configure any other settings.

   The nickname is used as a label in the Segment app, and Segment creates a related schema name in your warehouse.  The nickname can be anything, but we recommend using something that reflects the source itself and distinguishes amongst your environments (eg. SourceName_Prod, SourceName_Staging, SourceName_Dev).
4. Click **Add Source** to save your settings.
5. Contact your Selligent Customer Success Manager or Technical Project Manager to request that Selligent enable the Segment Source on your Selligent Marketing Cloud account.

## Send data to Selligent Marketing Cloud

Now that your Source is set up, you can connect it with Destinations.

Log into your downstream tools and check to see that your events appear as expected, and that they contain all of the properties you expect. If your events and properties don’t appear, check the [Event Delivery](https://segment.com/docs/connections/event-delivery/) tool, and refer to the Destination docs for each tool for troubleshooting.

If there are any issues with how the events are arriving to Segment, [contact the Selligent Marketing Cloud support team](mailto:scrum-redwood@selligent.com).
