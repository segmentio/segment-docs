[Antavo](http://www.antavo.com){:target="_blank"} allows you to synchronize loyalty events and profile updates into Segment.

The Antavo Source allows you to sync profile updates and loyalty events into Segment Destination apps and Segment warehouse.

This source is maintained by Antavo. For any issues with the
source, [contact the Antavo support team](mailto:support@antavo.com).

## Getting started

1. From your workspace's Sources catalog page click `Add Source`.
2. Search for "Antavo" in the Sources Catalog, select Antavo, and click Add Source.
3. On the next screen, you can name the Source (e.g. Antavo or Loyalty Engine).
   1. The name is used as a label in the Segment app, and Segment creates a related schema name in your warehouse.
   2. The name can be anything, but we recommend using something that reflects the source and distinguishes amongst your environments.
4. Click Add Source to save your settings.
5. Copy the Write key from the Segment UI.
6. Log into your Antavo account.
7. Select Twilio Segment integration in Antavo platform.

## Events

Antavo syncs two main types of events to Segment: Profile Updates and Loyalty Events. Profile Updates are sent as Segment Identify events, while Loyalty Events are sent as Segment Track events.

Both event types include a `userId`, which can be configured in Antavo. You can designate any customer attribute as the "external customer ID" to use as the Segment `userId`.

### Profile updates

Profile Updates occur when a customer attribute, added to the Antavo **Customer field sync**, updates. Customer attributes are included in the traits object.

```
{
  "traits": {
    "first_name": "New",
    "last_name": "Name",
  },
  "userId": "antavo-customer-id",
  "timestamp": "2024-11-26T15:19:14.000Z",
  "type": "identify",
}
```

### Loyalty events

Loyalty Events occur when a built-in or custom event, added to the Antavo Event sync, is triggered. The event data is then sent to the Segment Antavo Source. Event properties are included in the properties object.

```
{
  "properties": {
    "points": 5000
    },
  "type": "track",
  "event": "point_add",
  "userId": "antavo-customer-id",
  "timestamp": "2024-11-26T15:15:49.000Z",
}
```

### Integrations Object
Antavo automatically filters data from being sent to Salesforce destinations ([Salesforce (Actions)](https://segment.com/docs/connections/destinations/catalog/actions-salesforce){:target="_blank"}, [Salesforce Marketing Cloud (Actions)](https://segment.com/docs/connections/destinations/catalog/actions-salesforce-marketing-cloud){:target="_blank"}) and the [Antavo](https://segment.com/docs/connections/destinations/catalog/antavo){:target="_blank"} destination. This is achieved by adding these destinations to the [Integrations object](https://segment.com/docs/guides/filtering-data/#filtering-with-the-integrations-object){:target="_blank"} in the event payloads. Since Antavo has a dedicated Salesforce integration, this filtering helps prevent infinite loops.

## Adding Destinations

As the last step of the Antavo Source setup, you can select Destinations to receive data.

Log into your downstream tools and check to see that your events appear as expected, and that they contain all of the properties you expect. If your events and properties donâ€™t appear, check the [Event Delivery](https://github.com/segmentio/segment-docs/blob/develop/docs/connections/event-delivery){:target="_blank"} tool, and refer to the Destination docs for each tool for troubleshooting.

If there are any issues with how the events are arriving to Segment, [contact the Antavo support team](mailto:support@antavo.com).
