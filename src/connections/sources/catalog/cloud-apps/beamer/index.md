[Beamer](https://www.getbeamer.com/?utm_source=segmentio&utm_medium=docs&utm_campaign=partners) is a changelog and notification center that lets you announce new features, product updates, special offers and more.

This source is maintained by Beamer. For any issues with the source, [contact their team](mailto:info@getbeamer.com).

_**NOTE:** The Beamer Source is currently in beta, which means that they are still actively developing the source. This doc was last updated on January 28, 2020. If you are interested in joining their beta program or have any feedback to help improve the Beamer Source and its documentation, [let their team know](mailto:info@getbeamer.com)!_

> **Good to know**: This page is about the Beamer Segment source, which sends data _into_ Segment. There's also a page about the [Beamer Segment destination](/docs/connections/destinations/catalog/beamer/), which receives data from Segment!

## Getting Started

1. From your Segment UI's Sources page click on "Add Source".
2. Search for "Beamer" within the Sources Catalog and confirm the Source you'd like to connect to.
3. Give the Source a nickname and follow the setup flow to “Add Source”. The nickname will be used to designate the source in the Segment interface, and Segment will create a related schema name. The schema name is the namespace you’ll be querying against in your warehouse. The nickname can be whatever you like, but we recommend sticking to something that reflects the source itself and distinguishes amongst your environments (eg. SourceName_Prod, SourceName_Staging, SourceName_Dev).
4. Copy the Write key from the Segment UI and go to [Integrations](https://app.getbeamer.com/integrations) in your Beamer dashboard, then paste your write key in the **Integrate with Segment** section.
5. Click on **Save** and that's it!

## Events

Beamer uses a server-side `track` method to send all user interactions to Segment. Keep in mind Beamer will only send interactions from users that are identified with a `userId`, which must be provided by you. For more information on how to identify your users in Beamer, check out our [Developer Docs](https://www.getbeamer.com/docs) (see the `user_id` parameter).

Below is a table of events that Beamer sends to Segment. These events will show up as tables in your warehouse, and as regular events in your other Destinations.

## Adding Destinations

Log into your downstream tools and check to see that your events are populating and they contains all the properties you expect. If all your events and properties are not showing up, refer to the Destination docs for troubleshooting.

If you experience any issues with how the events arrive in Segment, [contact the Beamer team](mailto:info@getbeamer.com).
