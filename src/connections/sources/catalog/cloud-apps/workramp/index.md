[WorkRamp](https://www.workramp.com/products/external-learning/customer-academy/?utm_source=segmentio&utm_medium=docs&utm_campaign=partners) is the All-in-One Platform that powers learning as a growth engine for the modern enterprise.

This is an [Event Cloud Source](https://segment.com/docs/sources/#event-cloud-sources) which can not only export data into your Segment warehouse, but also federate data into other enabled Segment Destinations.

This source is maintained by WorkRamp. For any issues with the source, [contact the WorkRamp support team](mailto:support@workramp.com).

> info "The WorkRamp source is in Beta"
> WorkRamp are actively developing the source. This doc was last updated on June 2, 2022. If you are interested in joining their beta program or have any feedback to help improve the WorkRamp Source and its documentation, contact [support@workramp.com](mailto:support@workramp.com)



## Getting started

1. From your workspace's [Sources catalog page](https://app.segment.com/goto-my-workspace/sources/catalog) click **Add Source**.
2. Search for "WorkRamp" in the Sources Catalog, select WorkRamp, and click **Add Source**.
3. On the next screen, give the Source a nickname configure any other settings. 
   * The nickname is used as a label in the Segment app, and Segment creates a related schema name in your warehouse.  The nickname can be anything, but Segment recommends something that reflects the source itself and distinguishes amongst your academies or environments (for example, `WorkRamp_CustomerAcademy`, `WorkRamp_PartnerAcademy`, `WorkRamp_staging`).
5. Click **Add Source** to save your settings.
6. Copy the Write key from Segment, in your Source's Settings > API Key. 
7. Log in to your WorkRamp account - navigate to Academies > Your Academy > Integrations (for example, `https://app.workramp.com/admin/academies/[academy_id]/integrations`), toggle on the Segment integration, then paste your Segment Write Key in the "Write Key" field to connect. 


## Events

The table below lists events tracking user interaction in  WorkRamp Academy. WorkRamp sends these events to Segment, which appear as tables in your warehouse, and as regular events in other Destinations.

## Adding destinations

Once the source is configured, you can connect it to Destinations.

Log into your downstream tools and check to see that your events appear as expected, and that they contain all of the properties you expect. If your events and properties don’t appear, check the [Event Delivery](/docs/connections/event-delivery/) tool, and refer to the Destination docs for each tool for troubleshooting.

If there are any issues with how the events are arriving to Segment, [contact the WorkRamp support team](mailto:support@workramp.com).
