title: Salesforce Marketing Cloud
beta: true
---

[Salesforce Marketing Cloud](https://www.salesforce.com/ca/products/marketing-cloud/overview/), formerly known as 
ExactTarget, is a marketing automation suite with the ability to build complete customer journeys as well as creating, 
targeting, tracking, and managing email and digital media campaigns.

With the Segment Salesforce Marketing Cloud Source, you can extract data from Marketing Cloud and send them 
to a data warehouse such as Redshift or Big Query with ease, avoiding having to build your own expensive custom solutions.

If you are trying to setup Salesforce Marketing Cloud as a destination to receive data from Segment, check out
[Salesforce Marketing Cloud Destination](https://segment.com/docs/destinations/salesforce-marketing-cloud/).

_**NOTE:** The Salesforce Marketing Cloud Source is currently in beta. This means that component names and functionality
           may change. For all feedback, please [send us a note](https://segment.com/help/contact).

## Getting Started

###  API Access

To access the Salesforce Marketing Cloud data on your behalf, Segment requires the client ID, client secret and
subdomain from your Salesforce Marketing Cloud integration. The integration must also have the following permissions:


| Category   | Collection              | Permission Needed |
| ---------- | ----------------------- | ----------------- |
| Automation | Journeys (Interactions) | Read              |
| Contacts   | Lists and Subscribers   | Read              |
| Hub        | Campaigns               | Read              |

**If you already have a Salesforce Marketing Cloud Segment Destination**, you can choose to re-use the client ID,
client secret and subdomain setup for the destination. To enable the permissions required for the source:

1. Log in to your Salesforce Marketing Cloud account.
2. Click your name in the top-right corner of the screen and select "Administration".
3. Navigate to the existing package with the the Segment destination API Integration.
4. Adjust the scope according to the permission table above.
5. Click "Save".

**If you do not have a Salesforce Marketing Cloud Segment Destination**, follow the steps below to acquire the client ID
and client secret: 

1. Log in to your Salesforce Marketing Cloud account.
2. Click your name in the top-right corner of the screen and select "Administration".
3. Click the "Account" menu at the top-left corner of the page and select "Installed Packages".
4. If you want to use an existing package, click on that one or click "New" to create a new one. We recommend giving it
   a name like "Segment".
5. Click "Add Component".
6. Select "API Integration" and click "Next".
7. Select Server-to-Server
8. Enable the permissions as specified in the table above.
9. Click "Save".

You should now see a Summary page with a Components section. This section lists your _Client ID_ and _Client Secret_ settings.

### Set up your subdomain
Segment will use your unique Salesforce subdomain to make API calls to SFMC. Your subdomain is represented by a 28-character string starting with the letters "mc" in any of your base URIs. For example, in the base URI `mc563885gzs27c5t9-63k636ttgm.rest.marketingcloudapis.com`, the subdomain is `mc563885gzs27c5t9-63k636ttgm`.

### Enable the Salesforce Marketing Cloud Source
        
1. From your Segment workspace’s `/Sources` page, click `Add Source`.
2. Under the Email Marketing category, choose Salesforce Marketing Cloud and click `Connect`.
3. Give your source a name to identify it within your workspace.
4. Select the data warehouses to connect the source to.
5. Specify the Client ID and Client Secret values acquired from the [API Access](#api-access) section above.
6. Specify the subdomain aquired from the [Set up your subdomain](#set-up-your-subdomain) section above.


## Components

### Sync

The Salesforce Marketing Cloud source is built with a sync component, which means we’ll make requests to their API on 
your behalf on a 3 hour interval to pull the latest data into Segment. In the initial sync, we’ll grab all the 
Salesforce objects (and their corresponding properties) according to the Collections Table below. The objects will be 
written into a separate schema, corresponding to the source instance’s schema name you designated upon creation. 
For example, if you went with `sfmc_prod`, the `campaigns` collection will be accessible at `sfmc_prod.campaigns` in SQL.

Each sync will only sync the data that has been modified since the previous sync.

The source syncs and warehouse syncs are independent processes. Source runs pull your data into the Segment Hub, 
and warehouse runs flush that data to your warehouse. Sources will sync with Segment every 3 hours. Depending on your 
Warehouses plan, we will push the Source data to your warehouse on the interval associated with your billing plan.

## Collections

Collections are the groupings of resources we pull from your source. In your warehouse, each collection gets its own table.


| Collection      | Type   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                 |
