[HubSpot](http://www.hubspot.com) is an all-in-one marketing tool that helps attract new leads and convert them into paying customers, with features like landing page creation and email automation.

Are you trying to set up HubSpot as a destination to receive data from Segment? Go here [HubSpot Destination](https://segment.com/docs/connections/destinations/catalog/hubspot/).

## Getting Started

1. From your workspace's `/sources` page, click `add source`.

2. Choose HubSpot.

3. Give the source a nickname and a schema name. The nickname is a label used in the Segment interface, and the schema name is the namespace you query against in your warehouse. Both can be whatever you like, but we recommend sticking to something that reflects the source itself, like `HubSpot` for nickname and `hubspot`, `hub`, or `hubspot_prod` for the schema name.

   **Note**: You can add multiple instances if you have multiple HubSpot accounts. That's why we allow you to customize the source's nickname and schema name!

4. Finally, connect an account with **admin API permissions** to access your HubSpot data. This account should be an active user on a Professional or Enterprise plan. Check out [HubSpot's docs on how to get your API Key](http://knowledge.hubspot.com/articles/kcs_article/integrations/how-do-i-get-my-hubspot-api-key).

Voila! We'll begin syncing your HubSpot data into Segment momentarily, and it will be written to your warehouse at your next Warehouse run.


## Components

### Sync

The HubSpot source is built with a sync component, which means we'll make requests to their API on your behalf on a 3 hour interval to pull the latest data into Segment. In the initial sync, we'll grab all the HubSpot objects (and their corresponding properties) according to the Collections Table below. The objects will be written into a separate schema, corresponding to the source instance's schema name you designated upon creation (ie. my_source.charges).

Our sync component uses an upsert API, so the data in your warehouse loaded using sync will reflect the latest state of the corresponding resource in HubSpot. For example, if `ticket_status` goes from `open` to `closed` between syncs, on its next sync that tickets status will be `closed`.

The source syncs and warehouse syncs are independent processes. Source runs pull your data into the Segment Hub, and warehouse runs flush that data to your warehouse. Sources will sync with Segment every 3 hours. Depending on your Warehouses plan, we will push the Source data to your warehouse on the interval associated with your billing plan.


## Collections

Collections are the groupings of resources we pull from your source. In your warehouse, each collection gets its own table.

### Event History

Due to HubSpot's [API Rate Limits](http://developers.hubspot.com/apps/api_guidelines), by default, the HubSpot source only syncs the past month of data for `email_events` and `email_subscription_event_changes`.
