[Elastic Path CX Studio](https://www.elasticpath.com/products/cx-studio?utm_source=segmentio&utm_medium=docs&utm_campaign=partners){:target="_blank"} enables brands to build and deploy hosted storefronts and shoppable landing pages with dynamic personalization powered by your Segment data, all in a no-code visual editor.

This is an [Event Cloud Source](/docs/sources/#event-cloud-sources) that can not only export data into your Segment warehouse but also federate the exported data into your other enabled Segment Destinations.

Elastic Path maintains this source. For any issues with the source, contact the [Elastic Path Support team](https://support.elasticpath.com/hc/en-us){:target="_blank"}.

> info ""
> The Elastic Path CX Studio Source is currently in beta, which means that they are still actively developing the source. If you are interested in joining their beta program or have any feedback to help improve the Elastic Path CX Studio Source and its documentation, [let the Elastic Path team know](https://support.elasticpath.com/hc/en-us){:target="_blank"}.

## Getting started

1. Navigate to **Connections > Catalog** and make sure you're on the **Sources** tab of the catalog.
2. Search for **Elastic Path CX Studio** in the Sources Catalog, select **Elastic Path CX Studio**, and click **Add Source**.
3. Give the Source a name and configure any other settings.
   - The name identifies this source within your workspace, and typically reflects the name of the application. The name can be anything, but Segment recommends that you use something that reflects the source itself and distinguishes amongst your environments (for example, `ElasticPath_Prod`, `ElasticPath_Staging`, or `ElasticPath_Dev`).
4. Click **Add Source** to save your settings.
5. Copy the Write key from the Segment UI and [log in to the Elastic Path CX Studio](https://app.unstack.com/login){:target="_blank"}.
6. Navigate to **Settings > Integrations > Select Segment integration**, and input the Segment write key.

## Stream

Elastic Path CX Studio uses the stream Source component to send Segment event data. It uses a client-side (select from `track`, `identify`, `page`, `group`) method(s) to send data to Segment. These events are then available in any destination that accepts client-side events, and available in a schema in your data warehouse, so you can query using SQL.

The default behavior is for Elastic Path CX Studio to pass the `anonymousId` if user is not logged in or pass `userId` if user is logged in, where `anonymousId` is a session ID generated by Elastic Path CX Studio.

## Events

The following table lists events that Elastic Path CX Studio sends to Segment. These events appear as tables in your warehouse and as regular events in other destinations.

Note: CX Studio uses properties of these events from the [eCommerce Spec](/docs/connections/spec/ecommerce/v2) defined by the Segment doc.

## Identification

Elastic Path CX Studio automatically identifies users in Segment at certain points in their Elastic Path CX Studio session, to optimally connect your data across sessions and connections to other platforms (for example, Commerce Cloud).

### Session initialization

Elastic Path CX Studio initializes your Segment unify stream with an anonymous ID that corresponds to the Elastic Path CX Studio session id. This enables simple continuity of event streams. This session ID is further passed to Commerce Cloud and used to identify backend events with the same anonymous ID, for simple unification of all events in Segment.

### User identification

When a user has filled a form with an email address, that email is used to identify the user in a more permanent way. Specifically, forms with an email address may include any contact form or a checkout form. Checkout forms will identify the user even if abandoned after successfully completing the email field. This allows later retargeting of abandoned sessions.

When a user has registered an account in Elastic Path CX Studio and Commerce Cloud, the user is further identified in Segment with their Commerce Cloud user ID. This provides an additional connection point.

### The role of identification in personalization

Elastic Path CX Studio's Segment-unify personalization tooling is dependent on identity persistence. When a user revisits a session that has previously been identified, profile data can be retrieved from Segment including any augmented audience and trait data, which are referenceable within Elastic Path CX Studio for personalization. Refer to the Elastic Path CX Studio Personalization recipe for more information.

## Add destinations

After you configure your source, you can connect it with destinations. Log in to your downstream tools and check to see that your events appear as expected and that they contain all of the properties you expect. If your events and properties don’t appear, check the Event Delivery tool, and refer to the destination docs for each tool for troubleshooting. If there are any issues with how the events arrive to Segment, contact the [Elastic Path Support team](https://support.elasticpath.com/hc/en-us){:target="_blank"}.
