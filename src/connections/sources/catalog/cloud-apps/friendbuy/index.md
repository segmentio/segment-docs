## Prerequisites for Source Integration
In order to take advantage of this Source destination, you must be sending Friendbuy customer data either through  their ['track','order' JavaScript integration](https://developers.friendbuy.com/#tracking) or by POSTing shares and orders to the [REST API](https://developers.friendbuy.com/#rest-api).

## Send Data to Friendbuy
The Friendbuy Source works better when you also connect Friendbuy as a downstream destination within Segment. With the Friendbuy Destination, you can use Segment's snippets to load Friendbuy's JavaScript integration used to power loading widgets and tracking of customers, orders, and products. Check out the [Friendbuy Destination documentation](https://segment.com/docs/connections/destinations/catalog/friendbuy/) to get started.
