## Stream

Friendbuy uses our Segment Integration to stream event data to Segment in real time. It uses the server-side `track` and `identify` methods to send data to Segment. These events are then available in any destination that accepts server-side events, and available in a schema in your data warehouse, so you can query using SQL.

The default behavior is for Friendbuy to include an Anonymous ID for every event. The Anonymous ID is a hashed email. Friendbuy will also include a User ID, which is the Friendbuy the Customer ID.  If Friendbuy does not have the Customer ID, then only the Anonymous ID will be included.

## Adding Destinations

Now that your Source is set up, you can connect it with Destinations.

Log into your downstream tools and check to see that your events appear as expected, and that they contain all of the properties you expect. If your events and properties don’t appear, check the [Event Delivery](https://segment.com/docs/connections/event-delivery/) tool, and refer to the Destination docs for each tool for troubleshooting.

If there are any issues with how the events are arriving to Segment, [contact the Friendbuy support team](mailto:support@friendbuy.com).
