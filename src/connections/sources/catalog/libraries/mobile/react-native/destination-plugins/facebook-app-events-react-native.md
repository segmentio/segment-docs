title: Analytics React Native Facebook App Events Plugin
strat: react-native

## Getting Started



1. From the Segment web app, click **Catalog**.
2. Search for "Facebook App Events" in the Catalog, select it, and choose which of your sources to connect the destination to.
3. In the destination settings, enter your Facebook App ID which can be retrieved from your [Facebook Apps dashboard](https://developers.facebook.com/apps/).
4. Add the Plugin to your project. 

## Adding the dependency

You need to install the `@segment/analytics-react-native-plugin-facebook-app-events` and the `react-native-fbsdk-next` dependency.

Using NPM:
```bash
npm install --save @segment/analytics-react-native-plugin-facebook-app-events react-native-fbsdk-next
```

Using Yarn:
```bash
yarn add @segment/analytics-react-native-plugin-facebook-app-events react-native-fbsdk-next
```

Run `pod install` after the installation to autolink the Facebook SDK.

Follow the instructions in [Configure projects](https://github.com/thebergamo/react-native-fbsdk-next#3-configure-projects) of React-Native-fbsdk-next to finish the setup of FBSDK.

See [React Native FBSDK Next](https://github.com/thebergamo/react-native-fbsdk-next) for more details of this dependency. The plugin automatically calls the `Settings.initializeSDK();` method, so you do not need to explictly add that code to your app. Adding the method again may result in an error.

## Using the Plugin in your App

Follow the [instructions for adding plugins](https://github.com/segmentio/analytics-react-native#adding-plugins) on the main Analytics client:

In your code where you initialize the analytics client call the `.add(plugin)` method with an `FacebookAppEventsPlugin` instance:

```ts
import { createClient } from '@segment/analytics-react-native';

import { FacebookAppEventsPlugin } from '@segment/analytics-react-native-plugin-facebook-app-events';

const segmentClient = createClient({
  writeKey: 'SEGMENT_KEY'
});

segmentClient.add({ plugin: new FacebookAppEventsPlugin() });
```

## Screen

If you're not familiar with the Segment Specs, take a look to understand what the [Screen method](/docs/connections/spec/screen/) does. An example call would look like:

```ts
const { screen } = useAnalytics();

screen('ScreenName', {
  productSlug: 'example-product-123',
});
```

This integration also supports using Segment `screen` events as `track` events. For example, if you had a `screen` event named `Confirmation` you could map the invocation of this to a Facebook app event as you would with Segment `track` events.

To use this functionality you must opt into it using the integration setting named **Use Screen Events as Track Events**. Once enabled, you should start seeing `screen` events populate in Facebook App Events. The screen name you provide will be surrounded with the words **Viewed** and **Screen**. So, if you have a `screen` event with the name property set to `Welcome`, it will show up in Facebook as an event called **Viewed Welcome Screen**.

## Track

If you're not familiar with the Segment Specs, take a look to understand what the [Track method](/docs/connections/spec/track/) does. An example call would look like:

```ts
const { track } = useAnalytics();

track('View Product', {
  productId: 123,
  productName: 'Striped trousers',
});
```

When you call `track` Segment sends that event and it's properties to Facebook. In the Facebook analytics interface you'll be able to use the event properties to segment your data.

Facebook App Events doesn't like events with periods in the name so if you send an event with periods in the name, Segment converts all periods to underscores. So if your event is `friend.added`, Segment sends that to Facebook as `friend_added`. Segment also truncates events that are longer than 40 characters long due to Facebook's API constraints.

### Facebook Parameters

Segment translates [spec-matching properties](/docs/connections/spec/track/#properties) `revenue` and `currency` to the appropriate Facebook parameters (`valueToSum` and `FBSDKAppEventParameterNameCurrency`), and also send events with revenue to Facebook's purchase logging method (`logPurchase`).

If you don't provide a `currency` explicitly, Segment sends `USD`. If any properties don't match the below, Segment passes them on as they were sent.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>**Revenue**</td>
    <td>_valueToSum</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>**Currency**</td>
    <td>`fb_currency`</td>
  </tr>
</table>

## Limited Data Use

{% include content/facebook-ldu-intro.md %}

> info ""
> The **Use Limited Data Use** destination setting is disabled by default for all Facebook destinations except for Facebook Pixel. This must be enabled manually from the destination settings if you're using other Facebook destinations.

{% include content/facebook-ldu-params.md %}

Facebook uses the `context.ip` to determine the geolocation of the event.

You can manually change the Data Processing parameters by adding settings to the `integrations` object.

## Troubleshooting

### Not seeing events?
Verify that the [IDFA](/docs/connections/sources/catalog/libraries/mobile/ios/#idfa) is working within your app, which involves adding the [AdSupport and App Tracking Transparency frameworks](/docs/connections/sources/catalog/libraries/mobile/ios/#ad-tracking-and-idfa).

Once you've added these, you will start to see the `context.device.advertisingId` populate and the `context.device.adTrackingEnabled` flag set to `true` unless the user has ad tracking limited or is using a mobile ad blocker.

Facebook requires that payloads include the following:
- `context.device.id`
- `context.device.type`
- `context.os.version`

> info ""
> The value of `context.device.type` must be either `ios` or `android`.

For example:

```json
{
  "anonymousId": "507f191e810c19729de860ea",
  "event": "Event Name",
​  "context": {
    "device": {
      "id": "B5372DB0-C21E-11E4-8DFC-AA07A5B093DB",
      "type": "ios"
    },
    "os": {
      "version": "8.1.3"
    }
  },​
  "messageId": "bbac-11e4-8dfc-aa07a53436b09b45567i8245237824",
  "type": "track",
  "userId": "97980cfea0067"
}
```

### Missing custom events

Facebook will only accept custom events with alphanumeric names (you can include spaces, "-" and "\_") that are between 2 and 40 characters in length. Otherwise, Facebook will reject the event payload with a 400 status.
