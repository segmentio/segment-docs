With Analytics for React Native, you can collect analytics in your React Native application and send data to any analytics or marketing tool without having to learn, test, or implement a new API every time. Analytics React Native enables you to process and track the history of a payload, while Segment controls the API and prevents unintended operations.

All of Segment's libraries are open-source, and you can view Analytics for React Native on GitHub. For more information, see the [Analytics React Native GitHub repository](https://github.com/segmentio/analytics-react-native){:target="_blank"}.

> info "Using Analytics for React Native Classic?"
> Analytics React Native versions 1.5.1 and older are no longer supported by Segment. You can reference the [implementation guide](/docs/connections/sources/catalog/libraries/mobile/react-native/implementation/) to upgrade to the latest version.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Analytics for React Native library:

1. Create a React Native Source in Segment.
    1. Go to **Connections > Sources > Add Source**.
    2. Search for React Native and click **Add source**.
2. Install `@segment/analytics-react-native`, [`@segment/sovran-react-native`](https://github.com/segmentio/sovran-react-native){:target="_blank"} and [`react-native-get-random-values`](https://github.com/LinusU/react-native-get-random-values){:target="_blank"}:

    ```js
    yarn add @segment/analytics-react-native @segment/sovran-react-native react-native-get-random-values
    # or
    npm install --save @segment/analytics-react-native @segment/sovran-react-native react-native-get-random-values
    ```
3. If you want to use the default persistor for the Segment Analytics client, you also have to install `react-native-async-storage/async-storage.`

    ```js
    yarn add @react-native-async-storage/async-storage 
    # or
    npm install --save @react-native-async-storage/async-storage
    ```
    > info ""
    >If you wish to use your own persistence layer you can use the storePersistor option when initializing the client. Make sure you always have a persistor (either by having AsyncStorage package installed or by explicitly passing a value), else you might get unexpected sideeffects like multiple 'Application Installed' events

4. If you're using iOS, install native modules with:

    ```js
    npx pod-install
    ```

5. If you're using Android, you need to add extra permissions to your `AndroidManifest.xml`. 

    ```js
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE" />
    ```

6. Initialize and configure the Analytics React Native client. The package exposes a method called `createClient` which you can use to create the Segment Analytics client. This central client manages all the tracking events.

    ```js    
    import { createClient, AnalyticsProvider } from '@segment/analytics-react-native';

    const segmentClient = createClient({
      writeKey: 'SEGMENT_API_KEY'
    });
    ```

These are the options you can apply to configure the client:

## Adding Plugins to the Client

You can add a plugin at any time through the `segmentClient.add()` method. More information about plugins, including a detailed architecture overview and a guide to creating your own can be found [here](/docs/connections/sources/catalog/libraries/mobile/react-native/react-native-plugin-architecture/).

```js
import { createClient } from '@segment/analytics-react-native';

import { AmplitudeSessionPlugin } from '@segment/analytics-react-native-plugin-amplitude-session';
import { FirebasePlugin } from '@segment/analytics-react-native-plugin-firebase';
import { IdfaPlugin } from '@segment/analytics-react-native-plugin-idfa';

const segmentClient = createClient({
  writeKey: 'SEGMENT_KEY'
});

segmentClient.add({ plugin: new AmplitudeSessionPlugin() });
segmentClient.add({ plugin: new FirebasePlugin() });
segmentClient.add({ plugin: new IdfaPlugin() });
```
## Usage
You can use Analytics React Native with or without hooks. Detailed overviews of both implemenation options can be found below. 

### Usage with hooks
To use the `useAnalytics` hook within the application, wrap the application in an AnalyticsProvider. This uses the [Context API](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html){:target="_blank"} which allows access to the analytics client anywhere in the application.

```js
import {
  createClient,
  AnalyticsProvider,
} from '@segment/analytics-react-native';

const segmentClient = createClient({
  writeKey: 'SEGMENT_API_KEY'
});

const App = () => (
  <AnalyticsProvider client={segmentClient}>
    <Content />
  </AnalyticsProvider>
);
```

The `useAnalytics()` hook exposes the client methods:

```js
import React from 'react';
import { Text, TouchableOpacity } from 'react-native';
import { useAnalytics } from '@segment/analytics-react-native';

const Button = () => {
  const { track } = useAnalytics();
  return (
    <TouchableOpacity
      style={styles.button}
      onPress={() => {
        track('Awesome event');
      }}
    >
      <Text style={styles.text}>Press me!</Text>
    </TouchableOpacity>
  );
};
```
### Usage without hooks
To use the tracking events without hooks, call the methods directly on the client:

```js
import {
  createClient,
  AnalyticsProvider,
} from '@segment/analytics-react-native';

// create the client once when the app loads
const segmentClient = createClient({
  writeKey: 'SEGMENT_API_KEY'
});

// track an event using the client instance
segmentClient.track('Awesome event');
```

{% codeexample %}
{% codeexampletab Method signature %}
```js
track: (event: string, properties?: JsonMap) => void;
```
{% endcodeexampletab %}

{% codeexampletab Example use %}
```js
const { track } = useAnalytics();

track('View Product', {
  productId: 123,
  productName: 'Striped trousers',
});
```
{% endcodeexampletab %}
{% endcodeexample %}
  
### Core tracking methods

Once you've installed the Analytics React Native library, you can start collecting data through Segment's tracking methods:

- [Track](/docs/connections/sources/catalog/libraries/mobile/react-native/implementation/#track)
- [Identify](/docs/connections/sources/catalog/libraries/mobile/react-native/implementation/#identify)
- [Screen](/docs/connections/sources/catalog/libraries/mobile/react-native/implementation/#screen)
- [Group](/docs/connections/sources/catalog/libraries/mobile/react-native/implementation/#group)
- [Alias](/docs/connections/sources/catalog/libraries/mobile/react-native/implementation/#alias)

## Destinations
Destinations are the business tools or apps that Segment forwards your data to. Adding Destinations allow you to act on your data and learn more about your customers in real time.

<br>Segment offers support for two different types of Destinations, learn more about the differences between the two [here]().
