title: 1Flow Swift Plugin
---

[1Flow](https://1flow.ai/?utm_source=segmentio&utm_medium=docs&utm_campaign=partners){:target="_blank"} is a leading in-app user survey and messaging platform for Mobile app and SaaS businesses.

Using 1Flow, you can reach users _in-the-moment_ while they are interacting with your website or application to collect highly contextual user insights that help you improve your product offering and customer experience.

## Getting started

1. From the Segment web app, click **Catalog**, then search for **1Flow Mobile Plugin**.
2. Click **Add Destination**.
4. Select an existing Source to connect to 1Flow Mobile Plugin.
5. Go to **1flow.ai > Settings > Project Settings**, copy the 1Flow project key, and paste it into the Destination Settings in Segment.
6. Depending on the mobile source youâ€™ve selected, include 1Flow's library by adding the following lines to your dependency configuration.

## Adding the dependency

### Through Xcode

In the Xcode `File` menu, click `Add Packages`.  You'll see a dialog where you can search for Swift packages.  In the search field, enter the URL to this repository.
```
https://github.com/1Flow-Inc/segment-1flow-ios.git
```


You'll then have the option to pin to a version, or specific branch, as well as which project in your workspace to add it to. Once you've made your selections, click **Add Package**.  

### Through Package.swift

Open your Package.swift file and add the following to the `dependencies` section:

```swift
.package(
            name: "Segment",
            url: "https://github.com/1Flow-Inc/segment-1flow-ios.git",
            from: "1.0.0"
        ),
```

## Using the Plugin in your app

Open the file where you set up and configure the Analytics-Swift library.  Add this plugin to the list of imports.

```swift
import Segment
import SegmentOneFlow // <-- Add this line
```

Just under your Analytics-Swift library setup, call `analytics.add(plugin: ...)` to add an instance of the plugin to the Analytics timeline.

```swift
let analytics = Analytics(configuration: Configuration(writeKey: "<YOUR WRITE KEY>")
                    .flushAt(3)
                    .trackApplicationLifecycleEvents(true))
analytics.add(plugin: OneFlowDestination())
```

## Identify
If you're not familiar with the Segment Specs, take a look to understand what the [Identify method](/docs/connections/spec/identify/) does. An example call would look like:

```swift
analytics.identify(userId: "peter@example.com", traits: [
    "name": "Peter Gibbons",
    "email": "peter@example.com",
    "mobile": 1234567890
])
```
The Segment identify method is equivalent to `logUser` of 1Flow. `userId` will be `userID` and `traits` will be `userDetails`.

## Track
If you're not familiar with the Segment Specs, take a look to understand what the [Track method](/docs/connections/spec/track/) does. An example call would look like:

```swift
analytics.track(name: "ButtonClicked")
```
Any value passed in `name`, will be eventName and if you have passed any event property, then it will be event `parameters`.

## Screen

Send [Screen](/docs/connections/spec/screen) calls to record which mobile app screens users have viewed. For example:

```swift
analytics.screen(title: "Home")
```

Segment sends Screen calls to 1Flow as a `screen_[name]` event (or `screen_view` if a screen name isn't provided).
