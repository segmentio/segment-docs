Littledata's [Shopify to Segment connection](https://help.littledata.io/posts/segment-overview/){:target="\_blank"} uses a combination of client-side (browser) and server-side tracking to ensure 100% accurate data about your Shopify store in Segment. Littledata automatically integrates with Shopify and Shopify Plus sites to capture every customer touchpoint, including sales, marketing, customer and product performance data.

Littledata is available as an independent [Shopify App](https://apps.shopify.com/segment-com-by-littledata){:target="\_blank"}.

#### Client-side (device mode) tracking

After the [installation process](https://help.littledata.io/posts/segment-installation-guide/){:target="\_blank"}:

- Segment's Analytics.js 2.0 library loads on all pages, except for the checkout.
- All pages include a LittledataLayer data layer.
- Pages Load a minified tracking script, hosted on a content delivery network (CDN)
- Device-mode e-commerce events can send to all Segment destinations
- Segment's anonymous ID and Google Analytics' client ID passes to Littledata's servers to ensure consistent user journey tracking

#### Server-side (cloud mode) tracking

During the Segment connection setup, Littledata also adds a set of webhooks to your Shopify store. When a customer interacts with your store these changes are relayed server-side from Shopify to Littledata to Segment. The advantages to this approach are:

- 100% event capture for adds to cart, checkout steps, sales and refunds/returns
- Customer data (for example, email) securely relayed server-side
- No extra scripts on the sensitive and secure checkout pages
- Accurate marketing attribution, even when customers use ad-blockers or cookie opt-outs
- Supports cloud-mode destinations such as [Facebook Conversions API](/docs/connections/destinations/catalog/actions-facebook-conversions-api/)

Here's an architecture diagram that shows how the Littledata app mediates data flow between Shopify and Segment.

> warning "Note"
> This integration is maintained by Littledata _and isn't supported by Segment directly_. The Littledata app has been reviewed by the Segment team for conformance with Segment's [E-Commerce Spec](/docs/connections/spec/ecommerce/v2/), and is the recommended way of using Segment with Shopify. However, it does require a paid subscription with Littledata, who mediates the connection between Shopify and Segment. [Contact the Littledata Support team](mailto:help@littledata.io) with any questions.

## Event schema

This source has a full [tracking plan and event schema](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1aljowRhMU9_7uGXmcipbP1Y14S4cOSdXGQA2Vx7BHko/edit){:target="\_blank"} in Google Sheets, which is ready to [upload into Protocols](/docs/protocols/apis-and-extensions/#google-sheets-tracking-plan-uploader).

## Device-mode events

Below is a table of events that **Shopify by Littledata** sends to Segment through the analytics.js library. These events will show up as tables in your warehouse, and as regular events in your other Destinations supporting device-mode.

| Event Name            | Description                                                         |

> note ""
> \*This is less reliable than the de-duplicated `Order Completed` event sent from the Littledata servers, but you can use it in device-mode destinations to trigger a conversion. The `payment_method` and `shipping_method` properties are not available with this event.

You can _opt out_ of device-mode pageviews or events by setting `disableClientSideEvents: true` or `disablePageviews: true` in the `LittledataLayer` settings.

The source also respects [GDPR-compliant cookie](https://blog.littledata.io/2021/06/18/shopify-cookie-banner-gdpr-compliance/) consent via Shopify's cookie banner, or popular consent management platforms such as [OneTrust](https://help.littledata.io/help/integrating-onetrust-with-shopify/) and [TrustArc](https://help.littledata.io/posts/integrating-trustarc-with-shopify/).

## Cloud-mode events

Below is a table of events that **Shopify by Littledata** sends to Segment from Littledata's servers. These events appear as tables in your warehouse, and as regular events in your other Destinations that support cloud-mode. They include the `anonymousId` that links them to the device-mode events where the event was part of a previous user session, or associated with a `userId` that was previously linked with an `anonymousId`. See Littledata's [troubleshooting guide on attribution](https://help.littledata.io/posts/troubleshooting-marketing-attribution-for-shopify/) for more details.

## User identity

In the Littledata application you can choose which of the following fields you want to send as the `userId` for known customers:

- **Shopify customer ID** (default) - Recommended if you have a simple Shopify setup with minimal integrations.
- **Hashed email** - The MD5 email hash is useful if you have other marketing platforms sending traffic where you know the email of the visitor (for example, email marketing like Bronto or Marketo), but not their Shopify customer ID. Littledata uses an unsalted MD5 hash (\`createHash\` method) to match your other sources.
- **Email** - The email identifier is recommended when other platforms use the email and can't hash it, and you are comfortable with the privacy implications.
- **None** (no identifier) - Choose “none” if user identity is already handled by your Segment implementation and you only need the extra events powered by Littledata's Shopify source.

For [Engage](/docs/engage/), Littledata also sends `shopify_customer_id` as an [externalID](/docs/unify/identity-resolution/externalids/) for advanced matching.

## Identify calls

For every event where there is an identifiable Shopify customer (from both the device-mode and cloud-mode) Littledata also sends an Identify call. This happens when the customer logs into the storefront, on the last step of the checkout, with the order, and also after purchase with any customer update in Shopify admin.

The following traits are included with an Identify call:

| Property Name                | Description                                                                                                                                                                | Property Type |

## Support for Google Analytics destination

All events (device-mode and cloud-mode) contain the Google Analytics `clientId` field where known. This allows the [Google Analytics destination](/docs/connections/destinations/catalog/google-analytics/#supported-sources-and-connection-modes) to be configured in cloud-mode only, so all client side events are relayed via Segment's servers - reducing the scripts needed on your website.

## Support for email marketing destinations

Email marketing platforms such as [Klaviyo](/docs/connections/destinations/catalog/klaviyo/#server-side-track), [Iterable](/docs/connections/destinations/catalog/iterable/#track) and [Hubspot](/docs/connections/destinations/catalog/hubspot/#server) require an email property with any server-side event in order to associate events with a customer (they cannot use an `anonymousId`). Littledata adds that `email` property whenever an email address is set in the user `traits()` object (in device-mode) or from the Shopify customer record (in cloud-mode). Iterable can also [receive cookie values](#cookiesToTrack) with the Order Completed event.

## Alias calls

To support seamless customer tracking the [Mixpanel](/docs/connections/destinations/catalog/mixpanel/#alias), [Vero](/docs/connections/destinations/catalog/vero/#alias) and [KISSMetrics](/docs/connections/destinations/catalog/kissmetrics/#alias) destinations, Littledata ensures the pre-checkout `anonymousId` is added as an alias of the `userId` (used from checkout step 2 onwards).

## Subscription events

All [recurring orders in the Shopify checkout](https://help.littledata.io/posts/tracking-subscription-orders-in-the-shopify-checkout/){:target="\_blank"}, from any subscription app, are tracked as Order Completed events.

Additional subscription lifecycle events through Littledata's [ReCharge connection](https://www.littledata.io/connections/recharge){:target="\_blank"} are available in cloud-mode destinations. See the [Track (custom)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1aljowRhMU9_7uGXmcipbP1Y14S4cOSdXGQA2Vx7BHko/edit#gid=1155311093){:target="\_blank"} tab of the event schema.

## Import all orders

With an [annual Littledata Plus plan](https://www.littledata.io/app/enterprise){:target="\_blank"} you can import all Shopify orders and refunds from before you started using Segment, to sync with destinations that support timestamped events (for example, a data warehouse). This enables you to build a complete customer history in your chosen destination.

This data import includse all the [event properties](#event-properties) usually sent with an `Order Completed` event, including the [customer traits](#identify-calls).

## Advanced settings

You can customize Littledata's Shopify source from the [data pipeline settings](https://help.littledata.io/posts/data-pipeline-settings/){:target="\_blank"} in the Littledata admin. The general settings affect how Littledata handles details such as orders, products and pageviews. The more advanced settings include: `cookiesToTrack` and `CDNForAnalyticsJS`.

### cookiesToTrack

You can send any cookie set on a landing page (for example, a session identifier or marketing campaign name) to Segment with an Identify call. A common use is to set the array as `['iterableEmailCampaignId', 'iterableTemplateId']` to pass Iterable `campaignId` and `templateId` through to the [Order Completed event](https://support.iterable.com/hc/en-us/articles/204795719-Sending-Data-from-Segment-to-Iterable-#order-completed){:target="\_blank"}.

### CDNForAnalyticsJS

If you have a [proxy CDN setup](/docs/connections/sources/catalog/libraries/website/javascript/custom-proxy/) to load Segment's AnalyticsJS library from your own domain, you can specify it here.
