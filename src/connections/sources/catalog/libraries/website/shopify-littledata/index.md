Littledata is a smart analytics app that automates ecommerce tracking. Littledata's [Shopify-to-Segment connection](https://blog.littledata.io/help/posts/segment-overview/?utm_source=segmentio&utm_medium=docs&utm_campaign=partners) automatically tracks key ecommerce events on a Shopify or Shopify Plus store, so you can use Shopify as a source in your Segment workspace.

Littledata is available as an independent [Shopify App](https://apps.shopify.com/segment-com-by-littledata). When you install the Littledata app on your store, Littledata does two things:

1. It inserts a smart tracking script to your store's front end. You can use this script with any custom Shopify site, and uses analytics.js under the hood to send data in a spec-compliant manner to Segment.

2. The app also sets up server-side webhook forwarding to ensure 100% accuracy of important Customer and Order data.

Here's an architecture diagram that shows how the Littledata app mediates data flow between Shopify and Segment.

> warning "Note"
> This integration is maintained by Littledata _and is not supported by Segment directly_. The Littledata app has been reviewed by the Segment team for conformance with the [E-Commerce Spec](/docs/connections/spec/ecommerce/v2/), and is the recommended way of using Segment with Shopify. However, it does require a paid subscription with Littledata, who mediates the connection between Shopify and Segment. [Contact the Littledata Support team](mailto:support@littledata.io) with any questions.

## Getting Started

1. **Login** to your Shopify Store account.
2. Go the [Shopify app store listing](https://apps.shopify.com/segment-com-by-littledata) for **_Segment.com by Littledata_**.

3. Click **Add app** to begin the installation process.
4. **Sign up** for a Littledata account using an email address, Google login or Facebook login. _More team members can be added to the subscription after completing the installation process._
5. Add the [**Segment write key**](/docs/connections/find-writekey/) for the source that is going to send data in the **input field**.

6. Choose either an **Automatic** or a **Manual** install. _Automatic installs work in most instances, but if you choose to do a manual install, just follow [this guide](https://blog.littledata.io/help/posts/segment-installation-guide/)._

7. Segment's **analytics.js** library, Littledata **tracking script** and **webhooks** will be automatically applied to the store and the installation proccess will then be complete.

## Device-mode Events

Below is a table of events that **Shopify by Littledata** sends to Segment through the analytics.js libary. These events will show up as tables in your warehouse, and as regular events in your other Destinations supporting device-mode.

| Event Name            | Description                                                           |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Page Viewed           | The user has viewed a page                                            |
| Product List Viewed   | The user has viewed a product as they scroll down the collection page |
| Product Clicked       | The user has clicked a product within a product list                  |
| Product Viewed        | The user has viewed a product page                                    |
| Product Image Clicked | The user has clicked a product image                                  |
| Product Shared        | User has shared a product via social links                            |
| Thank you page        | User has viewed the thank you page after completing an order \*       |

\* This is less reliable than the de-duplicated `Order Completed` event sent from the Littledata servers, but you can use it in device-mode destinations to trigger a conversion. The `payment_method` and `shipping_method` properties are not available with this event.

In addition to the events tracked as standard, the following hits can be tracked based on page path:

| Event Name             | Description                                 |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Registration Viewed    | A prospect has viewed the registration page |
| Cart Viewed            | A prospect has viewed the cart              |
| Blog Viewed            | A prospect has viewed the blog              |
| Registration Completed | A prospect has completed registration       |

## Cloud-mode Events

Below is a table of events that **Shopify by Littledata** sends to Segment from Littledata's servers. These events appear as tables in your warehouse, and as regular events in your other Destinations that support cloud-mode. They include the `anonymousId` that links them to the device-mode events where the event was part of a previous user session, or associated with a `userId` that was previously linked with an `anonymousId`. See Littledata's [troubleshooting guide on attribution](https://blog.littledata.io/help/posts/troubleshooting-marketing-attribution-for-shopify/) for more details.

## Identify Calls

For every event where there is an identifiable Shopify customer (from both the device-mode and cloud-mode) Littledata also sends an Identify call. This happens when the customer logs into the storefront, on the last step of the checkout, with the order, and also after purchase with any customer update in Shopify admin.

The following traits are included with an Identify call:

| Property Name           | Description                                                                                                                                     | Property Type |

## Support for email marketing destinations

Email marketing platforms such as [Klaviyo](/docs/connections/destinations/catalog/klaviyo/#server-side-track), [Iterable](/docs/connections/destinations/catalog/iterable/#track) and [Hubspot](/docs/connections/destinations/catalog/hubspot/#server) require an email property with any server-side event in order to associate events with a customer (they cannot use an `anonymousId`). Littledata adds that `email` property whenever an email address is set in the user `traits()` object (in device-mode) or from the Shopify customer record (in cloud-mode).

## Alias Calls

To support seamless customer tracking the [Mixpanel](/docs/connections/destinations/catalog/mixpanel/#alias), [Vero](/docs/connections/destinations/catalog/vero/#alias) and [KISSMetrics](docs/connections/destinations/catalog/kissmetrics/#alias) destinations, Littledata ensures the pre-checkout `anonymousId` is added as an alias of the `userId` (used from checkout step 2 onwards).
