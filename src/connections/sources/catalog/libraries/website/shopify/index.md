This Shopify Source lets you send [Shopify Web Pixel API Standard Events](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/web-pixels-api/standard-events){:target="_blank"} from your Shopify Store to Segment. Events sent to Segment are formatted to match the [Segment Ecommerce Spec](/docs/connections/spec/ecommerce/v2/). 

This Source is a free [Shopify App Extension](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/app-extensions){:target="_blank"} which can be installed using your Shopify Store's Admin interface.  

#### Overview

Once installed and enabled, Segment collects events from the user's browser and sends them to your Segment 'Shopify' Source in real time. 

- You can control which Segment `track()` events get collected as well as how user profile details are passed to Segment.  
- A custom JavaScript snippet is loaded in the Shopify store. This script transforms Shopify Standard Events to Segment Ecommerce Spec events. Note that Segment's Analytics.js 2.0 library will **not** load on any Shopify store page. 
- You can control which Segment Track events get collected as well as how user profile details are passed to Segment.  
- This is a Device Mode (client side) Integration. No data is sent server-side from Shopify to Segment.  
- This source does not collect post-purchase events.
- The Segment anonymousId is set to the value of the Shopify client ID. The Segment userId value is never populated. 
- Email address and phone number details are sent to Segment if they are collected by Shopify.   

If you require more advanced functionality or want to collect post-purchase events, consider using the [Shopify by Littledata](/docs/connections/sources/catalog/libraries/website/shopify-littledata/) Source. Shopify by Littledata requires a paid subscription.

11. Use the checkboxes under 'Manage user profile details' to select how user profile details should be sent to Segment. 
12. Click the 'Turn On' button to enable start sending analytics events from your Shopify Store to Segment. 

## Identifiers

- **anonymousId** - The Segment `anonymousId` field are populated with the Shopify client ID. The Shopify client ID is a 'client-side ID of the customer, provided by Shopify'. You cannot configure the Segment anonymousId to be populated with any other value. 
- **userId** - The Segment `userId` field does not populate. You cannot configure the userId to be populated with any value from Shopify. 
- **email and phone** - `traits.email` and `traits.phone` are collected using Identify events (unless explicitly disabled in the 'Manage user profile details' section of the Shopify App User Interface).

## Sending user profile details to Segment

User profile details can be sent to Segment in 3 ways: 
1. As `traits` in Identify events.
2. As `properties` in Track events. 
3. As `traits` in Track events, included in the `context.traits` object.

User profile details are only sent to Segment when the following track events are triggered by Shopify: 
`Checkout Started`, `Address Info Entered`, `Shipping Info Entered`, `Contact Info Entered`, `Payment Info Entered` and `Order Completed`.

You can control how user profile details are sent to Segment on the 'Manage user profile details' section of the Shopify App User Interface.

### Why don't I see all of my events?
This Source uses client-side Javascript to send data to Segment. As with any client-side analytics tracking, some ad-blockers prevent data from being sent to Segment. This can lead to an under reporting of events to Segment. For more information about data loss associated with ad blockers, see the [Ad Blocking](/docs/connections/sources/catalog/libraries/website/javascript/#ad-blocking) documentation. 

### When do Identify events trigger?
To send Identify events, you must select the 'Send identify() calls' checkbox. If this setting is selected, Identify events are triggered when `Checkout Started`, `Address Info Entered`, `Shipping Info Entered`, `Contact Info Entered`, `Payment Info Entered` or `Order Completed` Track calls are triggered.

### Why aren't my Identify events triggering when expected?
To save on API call volume, Segment only triggers an Identify event when user profile details have changed. If no change is detected, then the Identify call is not triggered.  

### Why are some events duplicated and triggered multiple times?
Shopify sometimes erroneously triggers duplicate `Address Info Entered`, `Shipping Info Entered`, `Contact Info Entered`, `Payment Info Entered` events in short succession. This is a known bug with Shopify. Segment deduplicates the majority of these duplicate events but is unable to filter all of them out. 

### Why do some Address/Shipping/Contact/Payment Info Entered events contain product arrays?
Shopify sometimes includes product array details in [Standard Events](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/web-pixels-api/standard-events){:target="_blank"} which Segment uses to populate the `Address Info Entered`, `Shipping Info Entered`, `Contact Info Entered`, `Payment Info Entered` events. Segment includes these product details in Segment events.

### Why are some event properties missing even though the documentation indicates that they should be present?
Mapping code is in place to map the majority of valuable fields from Shopify's [Standard Events](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/web-pixels-api/standard-events){:target="_blank"} to Segment events. If properties are missing, it is due to the values not being provided by the Shopify event.
