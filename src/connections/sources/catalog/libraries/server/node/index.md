Segment's Analytics Node.js library lets you record analytics data from your node code. The requests hit Segment's servers, and then Segment routes your data to any destinations you have enabled.

The [Segment Analytics Node.js Next library is open-source](https://github.com/segmentio/analytics-next/tree/master/packages/node){:target="_blank"} on GitHub.

All of Segment's server-side libraries are built for high-performance, so you can use them in your web server controller code. This library uses an internal queue to make `identify` and `track` calls non-blocking and fast. It also batches messages and flushes asynchronously to Segment's servers.

## Getting Started

> warning ""
> Make sure you're using a version of Node that's 14 or higher. 

1. Run the relevant command to add Segment's Node library module to your `package.json`.

    ```bash
    # npm
    npm install @segment/analytics-node
    # yarn
    yarn add @segment/analytics-node
    # pnpm
    pnpm install @segment/analytics-node
    ```

2. Initialize the `Analytics` constructor the module exposes with your Segment source **Write Key**, like so:

    ```javascript
    import { Analytics } from '@segment/analytics-node'
    // or, if you use require:
    const { Analytics } = require('@segment/analytics-node')

    // instantiation
    const analytics = new Analytics({ writeKey: '<YOUR_WRITE_KEY>' })
    ```

  Be sure to replace `YOUR_WRITE_KEY` with your actual **Write Key** which you can find in Segment by navigating to: **Connections > Sources** and selecting your source and going to the **Settings** tab.

  This creates an instance of `Analytics` that you can use to send data to Segment for your project. The default initialization settings are production-ready and queue 20 messages before sending any requests. 


## Basic tracking methods
The basic tracking methods below serve as the building blocks of your Segment tracking. They include [Identify](#identify), [Track](#track), [Page](#page), [Group](#group), and [Alias](#alias).

These methods correspond with those used in the [Segment Spec](/docs/connections/spec/). The documentation on this page explains how to use these methods in Analytics Node.js Next.


### Identify

> info "Good to know"
> For any of the different methods described on this page, you can replace the properties and traits in the code samples with variables that represent the data collected.

`identify` lets you tie a user to their actions and record traits about them.  It includes a unique User ID and/or anonymous ID, and any optional traits you know about them.

You should call `identify` once when the user's account is first created, and then again any time their traits change.

Example of an anonymous `identify` call:

```javascript
analytics.identify({
  anonymousId: '48d213bb-95c3-4f8d-af97-86b2b404dcfe',
  traits: {
    friends: 42
  }
});
```

This call identifies the user and records their unique anonymous ID, and labels them with the `friends` trait.

Example of an `identify` call for an identified user:

```javascript
analytics.identify({
  userId: '019mr8mf4r',
  traits: {
    name: 'Michael Bolton',
    email: 'mbolton@example.com',
    plan: 'Enterprise',
    friends: 42
  }
});
```
The call above identifies Michael by his unique User ID (the one you know him by in your database), and labels him with the `name`, `email`, `plan` and `friends` traits.

The `identify` call has the following fields:

Field | Details
----- | -------
`userId` _String, optional_ | The ID for this user in your database. _Note: at least one of `userId` or `anonymousId` must be included in any identify call._
`anonymousId` _String, optional_ | An ID associated with the user when you don't know who they are (for example, [the anonymousId generated by `analytics.js`](/docs/connections/sources/catalog/libraries/website/javascript/#anonymous-id)). _Note: You must include at least one of `userId` or `anonymousId` in all identify calls._
`traits` _Object, optional_ | A dictionary of [traits](/docs/connections/spec/identify#traits) you know about the user. Things like: `email`, `name` or `friends`.
`timestamp` _Date, optional_ | A JavaScript date object representing when the identify took place. If the identify just happened, leave it out as Segment uses the server's time. If you're importing data from the past make sure to send a `timestamp`.
`context` _Object, optional_ | A dictionary of extra [context](https://segment.com/docs/connections/spec/common/#context) to attach to the call. _Note: `context` differs from `traits` because it is not attributes of the user itself._

Find details on the **identify method payload** in Segment's [Spec](/docs/connections/spec/identify/).

### Track

`track` lets you record the actions your users perform. Every action triggers what we call an "event", which can also have associated properties.

You'll want to track events that are indicators of success for your site, like **Signed Up**, **Item Purchased** or **Article Bookmarked**.

To get started, we recommend tracking just a few important events. You can always add more later!

Example anonymous `track` call:

```javascript
analytics.track({
  anonymousId: '48d213bb-95c3-4f8d-af97-86b2b404dcfe',
  event: 'Item Purchased',
  properties: {
    revenue: 39.95,
    shippingMethod: '2-day'
  }
});
```

Example identified `track` call:

```javascript
analytics.track({
  userId: '019mr8mf4r',
  event: 'Item Purchased',
  properties: {
    revenue: 39.95,
    shippingMethod: '2-day'
  }
});
```

This example `track` call tells us that your user just triggered the **Item Purchased** event with a revenue of $39.95 and chose your hypothetical '2-day' shipping.

`track` event properties can be anything you want to record. In this case, revenue and shipping method.

The `track` call has the following fields:

Field | Details 
----- | --------
`userId` _String, optional_ | The ID for this user in your database. _Note: at least one of `userId` or `anonymousId` must be included in any track call.
`anonymousId` _String, optional_ | An ID associated with the user when you don't know who they are (for example, [the anonymousId generated by `analytics.js`](/docs/connections/sources/catalog/libraries/website/javascript/#anonymous-id)). _Note: You must include at least one of `userId` or `anonymousId` in all track calls._
`event` _String_ | The name of the event you're tracking. We recommend human-readable names like `Song Played` or `Status Updated`.
`properties` _Object, optional_ | A dictionary of properties for the event. If the event was `Product Added`, it might have properties like `price` or `product`.
`timestamp` _Date, optional_ | A JavaScript date object representing when the track took place. If the track just happened, leave it out and we'll use the server's time. If you're importing data from the past make sure you to send a `timestamp`.
`context` _Object, optional_ | A dictionary of extra [context](https://segment.com/docs/connections/spec/common/#context) to attach to the call. _Note: `context` differs from `traits` because it is not attributes of the user itself._

Find details on **best practices in event naming** as well as the **`track` method payload** in the Segment [Spec](/docs/connections/spec/track/).

### Page

The [`page`](/docs/connections/spec/page/) method lets you record page views on your website, along with optional extra information about the page being viewed.

If you're using our client-side set up in combination with the Node.js library, page calls are **already tracked for you** by default. However, if you want to record your own page views manually and aren't using our client-side library, read on!

Example `page` call:

```js
analytics.page({
  userId: '019mr8mf4r',
  category: 'Docs',
  name: 'Node.js Library',
  properties: {
    url: 'https://segment.com/docs/connections/sources/catalog/librariesnode',
    path: '/docs/connections/sources/catalog/librariesnode/',
    title: 'Node.js Library - Segment',
    referrer: 'https://github.com/segmentio/analytics-node'
  }
});
```

The `page` call has the following fields:

Field | Details 
----- | --------
`userId` _String, optional_ | The ID for this user in your database. _Note: at least one of `userId` or `anonymousId` must be included in any page call.
`anonymousId` _String, optional_ | An ID associated with the user when you don't know who they are (eg., [the anonymousId generated by `analytics.js`](/docs/connections/sources/catalog/libraries/website/javascript/#anonymous-id)). _Note: at least one of `userId` or `anonymousId` must be included in any page call._
`category` _String, optional_ | The category of the page. Useful for things like ecommerce where many pages often live under a larger category.
`name` _String, optional_ | The name of the page, for example **Signup** or **Home**.
`properties` _Object, optional_ | A dictionary of properties of the page. A few properties specially recognized and automatically translated: `url`, `title`, `referrer` and `path`, but you can add your own too.
`timestamp` _Date, optional_ | A JavaScript date object representing when the track took place. If the track just happened, leave it out and we'll use the server's time. If you're importing data from the past make sure you to send a `timestamp`.
`context` _Object, optional_ | A dictionary of extra [context](https://segment.com/docs/connections/spec/common/#context) to attach to the call. _Note: `context` differs from `traits` because it is not attributes of the user itself._

Find details on the **`page` payload** in the Segment [Spec](/docs/connections/spec/page/).

### Group

`group` lets you associate an [identified user](/docs/connections/sources/catalog/libraries/server/node/#identify) with a group. A group could be a company, organization, account, project or team! It also lets you record custom traits about the group, like industry or number of employees.

This is useful for tools like [Intercom](/docs/connections/destinations/catalog/intercom/), [Preact](/docs/connections/destinations/catalog/preact/) and [Totango](/docs/connections/destinations/catalog/totango/), as it ties the user to a **group** of other users.

Example `group` call:

```javascript
analytics.group({
  userId: '019mr8mf4r',
  groupId: '56',
  traits: {
    name: 'Initech',
    description: 'Accounting Software'
  }
});
```

The `group` call has the following fields:

Field | Details
----- | --------
`userId` _String, optional_ | The ID for this user in your database. _Note: at least one of `userId` or `anonymousId` must be included in any group call.
`anonymousId` _String, optional_ | An ID associated with the user when you don't know who they are (eg., [the anonymousId generated by `analytics.js`](/docs/connections/sources/catalog/libraries/website/javascript/#anonymous-id)). _Note: at least one of `userId` or `anonymousId` must be included in any group call._
`groupId` _string | The ID of the group.
`traits` _dict, optional_ | A dict of traits you know about the group. For a company, they might be things like `name`, `address`, or `phone`. [Learn more about traits](/docs/connections/spec/group/#traits).
`context` _dict, optional_ | A dict containing any context about the request. To see the full reference of supported keys, check them out in the [context reference](/docs/connections/spec/common/#context)
`timestamp` _datetime, optional_ | A `datetime` object representing when the group took place. If the group just happened, leave it out and we'll use the server's time. If you're importing data from the past make sure you send `timestamp`.
`integrations` _dict, optional_ | A dictionary of destinations to enable or disable.

Find more details about `group`, including the **`group` payload**, in the Segment [Spec](/docs/connections/spec/group/).

### Alias

The `alias` call allows you to associate one identity with another. This is an advanced method and should not be widely used, but is required to manage user identities in _some_  destinations. Other destinations do not support the alias call.

In [Mixpanel](/docs/connections/destinations/catalog/mixpanel/#alias) it's used to associate an anonymous user with an identified user once they sign up. For [Kissmetrics](/docs/connections/destinations/catalog/kissmetrics/#alias), if your user switches IDs, you can use 'alias' to rename the 'userId'.

Example `alias` call:

```javascript
analytics.alias({
  previousId: 'old_id',
  userId: 'new_id'
});
```

The `alias` call has the following fields:

Field | Details 
----- | --------
`userId` _String_ | The ID for this user in your database.
`previousId` _String_ | The previous ID to alias from.

Here's a full example of how Segment might use the `alias` call:

```javascript
// the anonymous user does actions ...
analytics.track({ userId: 'anonymous_user', event: 'Anonymous Event' })
// the anonymous user signs up and is aliased
analytics.alias({ previousId: 'anonymous_user', userId: 'identified@example.com' })
// the identified user is identified
analytics.identify({ userId: 'identified@example.com', traits: { plan: 'Free' } })
// the identified user does actions ...
analytics.track({ userId: 'identified@example.com', event: 'Identified Action' })
```

For more details about `alias`, including the **`alias` call payload**, check out the Segment [Spec](/docs/connections/spec/alias/).

## Configuration

The second argument to the `Analytics` constructor is an optional list of settings to configure the module.

```javascript
const analytics = new Analytics({
    writeKey: '<MY_WRITE_KEY>',
    host: 'https://api.segment.io',
    path: '/v1/batch',
    maxRetries: 3,
    maxEventsInBatch: 15,
    flushInterval: 10000,
    // ... and more!
  })
```

Setting | Details
------- | --------
`writeKey` _string_ | The key that corresponds to your Segment.io project
`host` _string_ | The base URL of the API. The default is: "https://api.segment.io"
`path` _string_ | The API path route. The default is: "/v1/batch"
`maxRetries` _number_ | The number of times to retry flushing a batch. The default is: `3`
`maxEventsInBatch` _number_ | The number of messages to enqueue before flushing. The default is: `15`
`flushInterval` _number_ | The number of milliseconds to wait before flushing the queue automatically. The default is: `10000`
`httpRequestTimeout` _number_ | The maximum number of milliseconds to wait for an http request. The default is: `10000`
`disable` _boolean_ | Disable the analytics library for testing. The default is: `false`
`httpClient` _HTTPClient or HTTPClientFn_ | A custom HTTP Client implementation to support alternate libraries or proxies. Defaults to global fetch or node-fetch for older versions of node. See the [Overriding the default HTTP Client](#override-the-default-http-client) section for more details.

See the complete `AnalyticsSettings` interface [here](https://github.com/segmentio/analytics-next/blob/master/packages/node/src/app/settings.ts){:target="_blank"}.

## Graceful shutdown
Avoid losing events after shutting down your console. Call `.closeAndFlush()` to stop collecting new events and flush all existing events. If a callback on an event call is included, this also waits for all callbacks to be called, and any of their subsequent promises to be resolved.

```javascript
await analytics.closeAndFlush()
// or
await analytics.closeAndFlush({ timeout: 5000 }) // force resolve after 5000ms
```

Here's an example of how to use graceful shutdown:
```javascript
const app = express()
const server = app.listen(3000)

const onExit = async () => {
  await analytics.closeAndFlush()
  server.close(() => {
    console.log("Gracefully closing server...")
    process.exit()
  })
}
['SIGINT', 'SIGTERM'].forEach((code) => process.on(code, onExit))
```

### Collect unflushed events 
If you need to preserve all of your events in the instance of a forced timeout, even ones that came in after analytics.closeAndFlush() was called, you can still collect those events by using:

```javascript
const unflushedEvents = []

analytics.on('call_after_close', (event) => unflushedEvents.push(events))
await analytics.closeAndFlush()

console.log(unflushedEvents) // all events that came in after closeAndFlush was called
```

## Regional configuration
For Business plans with access to [Regional Segment](/docs/guides/regional-segment), you can use the `host` configuration parameter to send data to the desired region:
1. Oregon (Default) — `api.segment.io/v1`
2. Dublin — `events.eu1.segmentapis.com`

An example of setting the host to the EU endpoint using the Node library is:
```javascript
const analytics = new Analytics({
  ...
  host: "https://events.eu1.segmentapis.com"
});
```

## Error handling

To keep track of errors, subscribe and log all event delivery errors by running:

```javascript
const analytics = new Analytics({ writeKey: '<MY_WRITE_KEY>' })

analytics.on('error', (err) => console.error(err))
```


### Event emitter interface
The event emitter interface allows you to track events, such as `track` and `identify` calls, and it calls the function you provided with some arguments upon successful delivery. `error` emits on delivery error. 

```javascript
analytics.on('error', (err) => console.error(err))

analytics.on('identify', (ctx) => console.log(ctx))

analytics.on('track', (ctx) => console.log(ctx))
```

Use the emitter to log all HTTP Requests.

  ```javascript
  analytics.on('http_request', (event) => console.log(event))

  // when triggered, emits an event of the shape:
  {
      url: 'https://api.segment.io/v1/batch',
      method: 'POST',
      headers: {
        'Content-Type': 'application/json',
        ...
      },
      body: '...',
  }
  ```


## Plugin architecture
When you develop in [Analytics.js 2.0](/docs/connections/sources/catalog/libraries/website/javascript/), the plugins you write can improve functionality, enrich data, and control the flow and delivery of events. From modifying event payloads to changing analytics functionality, plugins help to speed up the process of getting things done.

Though middlewares function the same as plugins, it's best to use plugins as they are easier to implement and are more testable.

### Plugin categories
Plugins are bound by Analytics.js 2.0 which handles operations such as observability, retries, and error handling. There are two different categories of plugins:
* **Critical Plugins**: Analytics.js expects this plugin to be loaded before starting event delivery. Failure to load a critical plugin halts event delivery. Use this category sparingly, and only for plugins that are critical to your tracking.
* **Non-critical Plugins**: Analytics.js can start event delivery before this plugin finishes loading. This means your plugin can fail to load independently from all other plugins. For example, every Analytics.js destination is a non-critical plugin. This makes it possible for Analytics.js to continue working if a partner destination fails to load, or if users have ad blockers turned on that are targeting specific destinations.

> info ""
> Non-critical plugins are only non-critical from a loading standpoint. For example, if the `before` plugin crashes, this can still halt the event delivery pipeline.

Non-critical plugins run through a timeline that executes in order of insertion based on the entry type. Segment has these five entry types of non-critical plugins:

| Type | Details
------ | --------              
| `before`      | Executes before event processing begins. These are plugins that run before any other plugins run. <br><br>For example, validating events before passing them along to other plugins. A failure here could halt the event pipeline. <br><br> See the example of how Analytics.js uses the [Event Validation plugin](https://github.com/segmentio/analytics-next/blob/master/packages/browser/src/plugins/validation/index.ts){:target="_blank"} to verify that every event has the correct shape. 
| `enrichment`  | Executes as the first level of event processing. These plugins modify an event. <br><br> See the example of how Analytics.js uses the [Page Enrichment plugin](https://github.com/segmentio/analytics-next/blob/master/packages/browser/src/plugins/page-enrichment/index.ts){:target="_blank"} to enrich every event with page information. 
| `destination` | Executes as events begin to pass off to destinations. <br><br> This doesn't modify the event outside of the specific destination, and failure doesn't halt the execution.  
| `after`       | Executes after all event processing completes. You can use this to perform cleanup operations. <br><br>An example of this is the [Segment.io Plugin](https://github.com/segmentio/analytics-next/blob/master/packages/browser/src/plugins/segmentio/index.ts){:target="_blank"} which waits for destinations to succeed or fail so it can send it observability metrics.  
| `utility`     | Executes once during the bootstrap, to give you an outlet to make any modifications as to how Analytics.js works internally. This allows you to augment Analytics.js functionality.                                                                                                                                                                                

### Example plugins
Here's an example of a plugin that converts all track event names to lowercase before the event goes through the rest of the pipeline:

```js
export const lowercase: Plugin = {
  name: 'Lowercase events',
  type: 'enrichment',
  version: '1.0.0',

  isLoaded: () => true,
  load: () => Promise.resolve(),

  track: (ctx) => {
    ctx.updateEvent('event', ctx.event.event.toLowerCase())
    return ctx
  }
}

const identityStitching = () => {
  let user

  const identity = {
    // Identifies your plugin in the Plugins stack.
    // Access `window.analytics.queue.plugins` to see the full list of plugins
    name: 'Identity Stitching',
    // Defines where in the event timeline a plugin should run
    type: 'enrichment',
    version: '0.1.0',

    // Used to signal that a plugin has been property loaded
    isLoaded: () => user !== undefined,

    // Applies the plugin code to every `identify` call in Analytics.js
    // You can override any of the existing types in the Segment Spec.
    async identify(ctx) {
      // Request some extra info to enrich your `identify` events from
      // an external API.
      const req = await fetch(
        `https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users/${ctx.event.userId}`
      )
      const userReq = await req.json()

      // ctx.updateEvent can be used to update deeply nested properties
      // in your events. It's a safe way to change events as it'll
      //  create any missing objects and properties you may require.
      ctx.updateEvent('traits.custom', userReq)
      user.traits(userReq)

      // Every plugin must return a `ctx` object, so that the event
      // timeline can continue processing.
      return ctx
    },
  }

  return identity
}
```

You can view Segment's [existing plugins](https://github.com/segmentio/analytics-next/tree/master/src/plugins){:target="_blank"} to see more examples.

### Register a plugin
Registering plugins enable you to modify your analytics implementation to best fit your needs. You can register a plugin using this:

```js
// A promise will resolve once the plugins have been successfully loaded into Analytics.js
// Register multiple plugins at once by using the variable args interface in Analytics.js
await analytics.register(pluginA, pluginB, pluginC)
```

### Deregister a plugin
Deregister a plugin by using: 

```js
await analytics.deregister("pluginNameA", "pluginNameB") // takes strings
```

## Selecting Destinations

The `alias`, `group`, `identify`, `page` and `track` calls can all be passed an object of `integrations` that lets you turn certain destinations on or off. By default all destinations are enabled.

Here's an example with the `integrations` object shown:

```javascript
analytics.track({
  event: 'Membership Upgraded',
  userId: '97234974',
  integrations: {
    'All': false,
    'Vero': true,
    'Google Analytics': false
  }
})
```

In this case, Segment specifies that they want this `track` to only go to Vero. `All: false` says that no destination should be enabled unless otherwise specified. `Vero: true` turns on Vero.

Destination flags are **case sensitive** and match [the destination's name in the docs](/docs/connections/destinations/) (for example, "AdLearn Open Platform", "awe.sm", "MailChimp"). In some cases, there may be several names for a destination; if that happens you'll see a "Adding (destination name) to the Integrations Object" section in the destination's doc page with a list of valid names.

**Note:**

- Available at the business level, filtering track calls can be done right from the Segment UI on your source schema page. We recommend using the UI if possible since it's a much simpler way of managing your filters and can be updated with no code changes on your side.

- If you are on a grandfathered plan, events sent server-side that are filtered through the Segment dashboard will still count towards your API usage.

## Historical Import

You can import historical data by adding the `timestamp` argument to any of your method calls. This can be helpful if you've just switched to Segment.

Historical imports can only be done into destinations that can accept historical timestamped data. Most analytics tools like Mixpanel, Amplitude, Kissmetrics, etc. can handle that type of data just fine. One common destination that does not accept historical data is Google Analytics since their API cannot accept historical data.

**Note:** If you're tracking things that are happening right now, leave out the `timestamp` and Segment's servers will timestamp the requests for you.


## Batching

Segment's libraries are built to support high performance environments. That means it is safe to use Segment's Node library on a web server that's serving hundreds of requests per second.

Every method you call **doesn't** result in a HTTP request, but is queued in memory instead. Messages are then flushed in batch in the background, which allows for much faster operation.

By default, Segment's library will flush:

  - Every 15 messages (controlled by `settings.maxEventsInBatch`).
  - If 10 seconds has passed since the last flush (controlled by `settings.flushInterval`)

There is a maximum of `500KB` per batch request and `32KB` per call.

If you don't want to batch messages, you can turn batching off by setting the `maxEventsInBatch` setting to `1`, like so:

```javascript
const analytics = new Analytics({
  ...
  maxEventsInBatch: 1
});
```

Batching means that your message might not get sent right away. Every method call takes an optional `callback`, which you can use to know when a particular message is flushed from the queue, like so:

```javascript
analytics.track({
    userId: '019mr8mf4r',
    event: 'Ultimate Played',
  },
  (err, ctx) => {
    ...
  }
)
```

## Multiple Clients

Different parts of your application may require different types of batching, or even sending to multiple Segment sources. In that case, you can initialize multiple instances of `Analytics` with different settings:

```javascript
const marketingAnalytics = new Analytics({ writeKey: 'MARKETING_WRITE_KEY' });
const appAnalytics = new Analytics({ writeKey: 'APP_WRITE_KEY' });
```
## Override the default HTTP Client

Segment attempts to use the global `fetch` implementation if available in order to support several diverse environments.  Some special cases (for example, http proxy) may require a different implementation for http communication.  You can provide a customized wrapper in the Analytics configuration to support this.  Here are a few approaches:

Use a custom fetch-like implementation with proxy (simple, recommended)
```javascript
import { HTTPFetchFn } from '../lib/http-client'
import axios from 'axios'

const httpClient: HTTPFetchFn = async (url, { body, ...options }) =>
  axios({
    url,
    data: body,
    proxy: {
      protocol: 'http',
      host: 'proxy.example.com',
      port: 8886,
      auth: {
        username: 'user',
        password: 'pass',
      },
     },
    ...options,
  })

const analytics = new Analytics({
  writeKey: '<YOUR_WRITE_KEY>',
  httpClient,
})
```
Augment the default HTTP Client
```javascript
import { FetchHTTPClient, HTTPClientRequest  } from '@segment/analytics-node' 
 
class MyClient extends FetchHTTPClient {
  async makeRequest(options: HTTPClientRequest) {
    return super.makeRequest({
        ...options, 
        headers: { ...options.headers, foo: 'bar' }
      }})
  }
}

const analytics = new Analytics({ 
  writeKey: '<YOUR_WRITE_KEY>', 
  httpClient: new MyClient() 
})
```
Completely override the full HTTPClient (Advanced, you probably don't need to do this)
```javascript
import { HTTPClient, HTTPClientRequest } from '@segment/analytics-node'

class CustomClient implements HTTPClient {
  async makeRequest(options: HTTPClientRequest) {
    return someRequestLibrary(options.url, { 
      method: options.method,
      body: JSON.stringify(options.data) // serialize data
      headers: options.headers,
    })
  }
}
const analytics = new Analytics({ 
  writeKey: '<YOUR_WRITE_KEY>', 
  httpClient: new CustomClient() 
})
```
