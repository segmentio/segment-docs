title: Analytics-CSharp (C#) Migration Guide

If youâ€™re currently using Analytics.NET or Analytics.Xamarin to send data to Segment, please follow the steps below to migrate to the [Analytics-CSharp library](/docs/connections/sources/catalog/libraries/server/csharp/).  

> success ""
> Analytics-C# does not include `v1` as part of the `url` address. If you are using the Segment EU endpoint, you will have to pass it manually. For instance, `events.eu1.segmentapis.com/v1`

You can update to Analytics-CSharp in 3 steps:
1. Bundle Analytics-CSharp into your app and remove your previous SDK.
2. Change the namespaces.
3. *(Optional)* Use `Reset` to stay anonymous.


## Migration steps

1. Add the Analytics-CSharp dependency to your project. 

    <br> Before:
    ```js
    dotnet add package Analytics --version <VERSION>
    ```

     <br> Before *(for Xamarin users only)*:
    ```js
    git clone https://github.com/segmentio/Analytics.Xamarin.git
    ```

    <br>After:
    ```js
    dotnet add package Segment.Analytics.CSharp --version <VERSION>
    ```

2. Replace namespaces. 

      <br> Before:
      ```c#    
        using Segment;
        using Segment.Flush;
        using Segment.Model;
        using Segment.Request;
      ```

      <br> After:
      ```c#    
        using Segment.Analytics;
        using Segment.Analytics.Compat;
      ```

3. *(Optional)* Update calls that resets the anonymous ID. 
   
    The old SDK requires you to provide the anonymous ID. The new SDK generates an Anonymous ID for you if you never call `analytics.Identify`. If you call `Identify` and want to go back to anonymous, the new SDK provides a `Reset` function to achieve that.

      <br> Before:
      ```c#                  
      Analytics.Client.Page(null, "Login", new Properties(), new Options()
      .SetAnonymousId("some-id"));
      ```

      <br> After:
      ```c#                  
      analytics.Reset();
      ```

## Optional changes for unit tests

Change your development settings if you would like to make analytics run synchronously for testing purposes.

<br> Before:
  ```c#                  
  Analytics.Initialize("YOUR_WRITE_KEY", new Config().SetAsync(false));
  ```

<br> After:
  ```c#                  
  var configuration = new Configuration("YOUR WRITE KEY",
    useSynchronizeDispatcher: true);
  var analytics = new Analytics(configuration);
  ```
