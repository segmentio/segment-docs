title: Aircall Source
---


Connect [Aircall](https://aircall.io) with Segment to bring Aircall events and phone call data to your data warehouse. Improve your knowledge of customer touchpoints by leveraging call activity.

This is an [Event Cloud Source](https://segment.com/docs/sources/#event-cloud-sources) which can not only export data into your Segment warehouse, but they can also federate the exported data into your other enabled Segment Destinations.

This source is maintained by Aircall. For any issues with the source, please [reach out to their team](support@aircall.io).

_**NOTE:** The Aircall Source is currently in beta, which means that they are still actively developing the source. This doc was last updated on October 4, 2019. If you are interested in joining their beta program or have any feedback to help improve the Aircall Source and its documentation, please [let  their team know](support@aircall.io)!_

## Getting Started

Before you start, make sure that you have admin rights in both Aircall and Segment.

To begin, [login](https://dashboard-v2.aircall.io/login) to your Aircall account.

From your Aircall **Dashboard**, select **Integrations** on the left sidebar menu.
* Select **Segment**
* Click on **Install**

Now you will be guided through three easy steps outlined below.

## **Step 1: Authenticate Aircall**
* Click on **Connect** to **Aircall**.
    * This will open a screen for you to add a required Authentication name. It will not be visible anywhere so any name can be used here -- either the suggested default or a name that you choose yourself.

* Click **Add** and a pop-up will appear.
    * From the pop-up, click on Authorize to allow this integration to access information about your calls in Aircall.

If the integration is successful, you will see a message that says "Authentication for Aircall successfully created." Once you see this, click on Next.


## **Step 2: Authenticate Segment**

Click on **Connect to Segment**
- This will open a screen for you to add a required **Authentication name**. You will see a default name already provided for you. While a name is required, it will not be visible anywhere -- either use the suggested default or a name that you choose yourself.

- A **Write Key** is required. This is a unique tracking key for your project. You can find this key from the Segment dashboard by following the steps below.
    * Login to your Segment account.
    * Go to Source from the left sidebar menu.
    * Click on Add Source and scroll to select HTTP API

    * Click on **Connect**

    * When creating a new Source setup, you will need to choose a name. We recommend that you choose an identifiable name such as "Aircall" for recognition. Then you may choose the warehouses or destination(s) where you'd like your data to be synced.

    * Once your source has been created, a **Write Key** will be generated. **Copy** this key and return to the configuration steps in Aircall to paste the key in the field as shown below.

        - Note: if you see a field to input a **Personas Key**, please note that this field is not required and you can leave this field blank. We are working to remove it from the installation flow.

    * When finished, click on **Add**.

If the integration is successful, you will see a message that says "Authentication for Segment successfully created." Once you see this, click on **Next**.


## **Step 3: Select Aircall events to send to Segment**
- There are up to [26 Aircall events](https://developer.aircall.io/api-references/#events) that can be pushed to Segment. As such, you will see a list of 26 possible events pre-populated for you as the default setting is for all and every Aircall event to be pushed to Segment.

- **If there are events that you do not want to be sent to Segment**, please delete the default value(s) shown in the list of 26 events (or write "null") if you determine that certain events should not be a source for Segment.

- Click on **Finish**.


Your integration is active! Now just connect the Aircall number(s) that you would like to be active for this integration and, that's it! You're all set and ready to get the most out of your Aircall-Help Segment integration.

## Adding Destinations

Now that your Source is set up, you can connect it with Destinations.

Log into your downstream tools and check to see that your events are populating and they contains all the properties you expect. If all your events and properties are not showing up, refer to the Destination docs for troubleshooting.

If there are any issues with how the events are arriving to Segment, please [contact the Aircall team](mailto:support@aircall.io).
