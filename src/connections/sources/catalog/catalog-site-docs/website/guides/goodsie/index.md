Installing Segment in a Goodsie store couldn't get much easier. All you have to do is add your Segment **Write Key** to your Goodsie plugins page.

## Step 1: Segment Account

Start by creating a Segment account. We recommend creating an organization so you can invite teammates to your account in the future.

Once your account is created add a new project. You can skip through the regular setup process and go right to your destinations page. Our friends at Goodsie already did the development work for us.


## Step 2: Activate Plugin

From your destinations page click on the gear icon for your source settings. Then click on API Keys and copy the **Write Key** to your clipboard.

Login to your Goodsie account and navigate to **Manage > Plugins**. Paste your **Write Key** into the Segment form field, scroll down, and click Save.

Now Segment is loading on your Goodsie store, yipee!


## Step 3: Try Out Tools

The last step is to have some fun. Explore the Segment destinations page to find interesting new tools and sign up for a few free trials to see what works for your business.
