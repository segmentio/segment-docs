title: Add or Update Profiles and Traits with a CSV

You can use the Profiles CSV Uploader to add or update user profiles and traits. This page contains guidelines for your CSV upload and explains how to upload a CSV file to Unify.

## CSV file upload guidelines

Keep the following guidelines in mind as you upload CSV files:

- You can only upload `.csv` files.
- Files can't be empty and must have at least one header and one row.
- You can't have multiple columns with the same header.
- CSV files cannot exceed 1 million rows (plus one header row), 299 columns, or 100 MB in file size.
- You can only upload one file at a time.
- Add an identifier column or `anonymous_id` in your identity resolution configuration.
- Leave any unknown values blank to avoid bad data. Segment can create a user profile from a single identifier in your CSV.
- The template won't include duplicate custom traits, traits with trailing, leading, or multiple consecutive spaces between characters, or [unallowed characters](#allowed-csv-file-characters).
- Custom traits column headers are case-sensitive. For example, `first Name`, `FIRST Name`, and `First Name` would all be different traits in the template.
- Trailing, leading, or multiple consecutive spaces between characters are not allowed.
- The CSV uploader shares [Unify product limits](/docs/unify/product-limits/).
