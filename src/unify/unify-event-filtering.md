Unify Event Filtering lets you control which events reach your Unify space. 

## Overview

With Unify Event Filtering, you can use block events that aren’t useful for identity resolution or downstream activation, keeping your space cleaner and more efficient.

Event Filtering is useful when you’re sending a lot of different event types into Segment but only some of them are relevant to Unify. For example, you might want to:

- Drop telemetry or system events that don’t describe user behavior
- Filter out events from certain regions or user groups
- Keep events in Connections, but exclude them from Unify
