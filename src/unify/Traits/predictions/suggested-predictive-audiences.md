Suggested Predictive Audiences can help you improve customer engagement, drive higher conversion rates, and reduce ad spend.

This page explains what a Suggested Predictive Audience is, how to build a Suggested Predictive Audience, and what each available Audience targets.

## Suggested Predictive Audience basics

A Suggested Predictive Audience is an out-of-the-box Audience template driven by machine learning.

Segment offers [five templates](/docs/unify/traits/predictions/suggested-predictive-audiences/#suggested-predictive-audience-types) that are prebuilt with [Predictions](/docs/unify/traits/predictions) like likelihood to purchase and lifetime predicted value. Selecting a template generates a Predictive Audience whose members you can engage in a number of ways:

- [Send an email or SMS campaign](/docs/engage/campaigns/) with a discount code
- Promote a new product line with a drip campaign
- Target the Audience members with online ads
- Send personalized product recommendations

## Build a Suggested Predictive Audience

Follow these steps to build a Suggested Predictive Audience:

1. In your Segment workspace, navigate to **Engage > Audiences**.
2. From the Audiences tab, select **Go to Predictive Audiences**.
3. On the Audience you want to build, click **Build Audience > + Add Audience**.
4. Select the Audience type you want to build, then click **Next**.
5. On the **Set up requirements** tab, confirm that you have the right events and traits required for the Suggested Predictive Audience, then click **Next**.
 - If you're missing a required event or trait, Segment prompts you to select it from the dropdown and match it to the required field(s).
6. Preview your Audience, then click **Next**.
7. (Optional:) Connect the new Audience to a Destination.
8. Give your Suggested Predictive Audience a name, then click **Create Audience**.

Your Suggested Predictive Audience is now live.

## Suggested Predictive Audience types

Engage offers five Suggested Predictive Audiences. The following table summarizes the customers each Audience targets and the events and traits Engage uses to build the Audience:
