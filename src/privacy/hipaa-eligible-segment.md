Segment is a HIPAA eligible platform, and meets the data privacy and security requirements of healthcare customers and their stakeholders. For more information about Segment becoming HIPAA eligible, see the [announcement blog post](http://segment.com/blog/segment-for-healthcare){:target="_blank"}.

## Business Associate Addendum

> info ""
> Twilio BAA are available to customers on a Business Tier plan.

Before you begin, check that the Segment products and services you'll use for your HIPAA workflows are on the list of Twilio's [HIPAA Eligible Products and Services](https://twil.io/HIPAA-eligible-products-and-services){:target="_blank"}. After you've verified availability, contact your Account Expert to [request a demo](https://segment.com/contact/sales/){:target="_blank"}.

## Verify your Workspace

Ensure your Workspace is eligible for HIPAA before you configure and send any personal health information (PHI).

1. In your Workspace, navigate to **Settings > Workspace Settings**.
2. On the **General Settings** tab, ensure that the HIPAA badge appears. This badge confirms that the Workspace is HIPAA eligible. ![HIPAA Eligible](images/hipaa-eligible.png)

With the BAA signed and Workspace confirmed as eligible, you can start building. For more information about starting a HIPAA compliant implementation, see Twilio's [Architecting for HIPAA on Twilio](https://twil.io/architecting-for-hipaa){:target="_blank"}, which outlines the shared responsibilities and requirements for building and maintaining HIPAA-compliant workflows in Segment.

## HIPAA Auditing
Segment maintains audit logs of every read and update action a user performs in the Segment app that may involve PHI/PII. 

Data captured in the HIPAA audit logs includes:
 - `workspace_id`: unique identifier of the workspace
 - `actor_user_id`: unique identifier Segment assigns to the logged in user
 - `event_type`: The action performed by the user. For example, `Source Debugger Raw Viewed`, `Destination Filter Modified`, or other events
 - `end_user_id`: Segment sometimes assigns this unique identifier to an end-user, event, audience, or journey, depending on the event type
 - `timestamp`: Time in UTC when the action occurred

These logs can be provided upon request. For specific requests, please reach out to [friends@segment.com](mailto:friends@segment.com){:target="_blank"}.

## Data encryption

Segment encrypts the data in select fields [marked as yellow in the Privacy Portal](/docs/privacy/portal/#default-pii-matchers) before sending them to event stream, cloud mode destinations, further supporting HIPAA compliance in your destinations. Segment encrypts data using a RSAES OAEP SHA 256 algorithm.

Data encryption does not support "fuzzy matching". You can encrypt [Default PII matchers](/docs/privacy/portal/#default-pii-matchers), [Custom PII matchers](/docs/privacy/portal/#custom-pii-matchers), and any [Synonyms](/docs/privacy/portal/#using-synonyms) you've created for keys.

> info "Data encryption only supports event-stream, cloud-mode destinations"
> Only data fields in `context`, `traits`, and `property` objects can be encrypted. 
>
> After Segment encrypts the data, the encrypted data value is always a `string`. Any downstream validation that looks for `integer` or `boolean` data types will fail for encrypted values.

### Configure data encryption for a new destination

To configure data encryption while setting up a new destination:
1. From the [Destinations page in the Segment App](https://app.segment.com/goto-my-workspace/destinations/){:target="_blank"}, click **Add destination**.
2. Select a destination from the catalog and click **Configure**.
3. On the destination's overview page, click **Add destination**. 
4. On the Select data source page, select the source you want to connect to your destination and click **Next**.
5. On the Setup page, give your destination a name, fill in any optional settings, and select the **Have Segment encrypt sensitive data** checkbox.
6. Open the **Fields** dropdown, select one or more fields you'd like to encrypt and click the **Generate Encryption Keys** button. You can select [Default PII matchers](/docs/privacy/portal/#default-pii-matchers), [Custom PII matchers](/docs/privacy/portal/#custom-pii-matchers), and any [Synonyms](/docs/privacy/portal/#using-synonyms) you've created for keys. Data encryption does not support "fuzzy matching".<br> *If you don't see all of the fields that you want to encrypt, [change the classification of your missing data fields](/docs/privacy/portal/#change-a-recommended-classification) to Yellow in the Privacy Portal*.<br> 
7. Securely store your private key.  <br> **Note:** Once you finish setting up the destination, you cannot retrieve the key. 
8. Click **Create destination**.

> error "Private Key is not recoverable"
> Segment does not save the private key created during the data encryption setup flow, and cannot retrieve the key after you finish setting up your destination. You can generate a new key using the instructions in the [Configure new key pairs](#configure-new-key-pairs) section. Any data encrypted prior to generating a new key pair cannot be decrypted with the new key. 

### Configure data encryption for an existing destination
 
To configure data encryption for an existing destination:
1. Open the [My destinations page](https://app.segment.com/goto-my-workspace/destinations){:target="_blank”} in the Segment app.
2. Select a destination, and click the **Data Encryption** tab.
3. On the Data Encryption page, select the **Have Segment encrypt sensitive data** checkbox.
4. Open the **Fields** dropdown, select one or more fields you'd like to encrypt and click the **Generate Encryption Keys** button. You can select [Default PII matchers](/docs/privacy/portal/#default-pii-matchers), [Custom PII matchers](/docs/privacy/portal/#custom-pii-matchers), and any [Synonyms](/docs/privacy/portal/#using-synonyms) you've created for keys. Data encryption does not support "fuzzy matching".<br> *If you don't see all of the fields that you want to encrypt, [change the classification of your missing data fields](/docs/privacy/portal/#change-a-recommended-classification) to Yellow in the Privacy Portal*.<br> 
5. Securely store your private key.  <br> **Note:** Once you finish setting up the destination, you cannot retrieve the key.
6. Click **Save**.

> error "Private Key is not recoverable"
> Segment does not save the private key created during the data encryption setup flow, and cannot retrieve the key after you finish setting up your destination. You can generate a new key using the instructions in the [Configure new key pairs](#configure-new-key-pairs) section. Any data encrypted prior to generating a new key pair cannot be decrypted with the new key. 

### Configure new key pairs

If you lose access to your private key, you can generate a new key pair in your destination's Data Encryption tab. Any data previously encrypted using the previous key pair is unaffected, but cannot be decrypted using the new key.

To generate a new key pair:
1. Open the [My destinations page](https://app.segment.com/goto-my-workspace/destinations){:target="_blank”} in the Segment app.
2. Select the destination you'd like to create new keys for and click **Data Encryption**.
3. Click **Regenerate Encryption Keys**.
4. Securely store your private key.  <br> **Note:** Once you finish setting up the destination, you cannot retrieve the key.
5. Click **Save Changes** to update the key pair. 

### Edit encrypted fields

After enabling encryption for a destination, you can add or remove encrypted data fields in your destination's **Data Encryption** tab. All changes made to fields are forward-looking. You may experience some latency between making the changes and having the changes take effect.

To make changes to your selected fields:
1. Open the [My destinations page](https://app.segment.com/goto-my-workspace/destinations){:target="_blank”} in the Segment app.
2. Select the destination you'd like to edit your selected fields for and click **Data Encryption**.
3. Add or remove fields. You can select [Default PII matchers](/docs/privacy/portal/#default-pii-matchers), [Custom PII matchers](/docs/privacy/portal/#custom-pii-matchers), and any [Synonyms](/docs/privacy/portal/#using-synonyms) you've created for keys. Data encryption does not support "fuzzy matching".
  - To add fields, click the **Fields** box to open the dropdown and select the fields you'd like to add.
  - To remove fields, click the **x** icon next to the name of the field you'd like to remove. 
4. Click **Save Changes**. 


### Remove encryption

Disabling the data encryption setting removes encryption on all previously configured data.

To remove encryption from incoming data:
1. Open the [My destinations page](https://app.segment.com/goto-my-workspace/destinations){:target="_blank”} in the Segment app.
2. Select a destination, and click **Data Encryption**.
3. On the Data Encryption page, deselect the **Have Segment encrypt sensitive data** checkbox.
4. On the **Turn off data encryption?** popup, click **Confirm**.

> success ""
> Disabling the data encryption setting does not decrypt existing data, but does prevent any future data from being encrypted.

## User session timeouts

Segment automatically logs out all users with access to HIPAA eligible workspaces after 15 minutes of inactivity.
