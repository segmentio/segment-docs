## Verify your Workspace

Ensure your Workspace is eligible for HIPAA before you configure and send any personal health information (PHI).

1. In your Workspace, navigate to **Settings > Workspace Settings**.
2. On the **General Settings** tab, ensure that the HIPAA badge appears. This badge confirms that the Workspace is HIPAA eligible. ![HIPAA Eligible](images/hipaa-eligible.png)

With the BAA signed and Workspace confirmed as eligible, you can start building. For more information about starting a HIPAA compliant implementation, see Twilio's [Architecting for HIPAA on Twilio](https://twil.io/architecting-for-hipaa){:target="_blank"}, which outlines the shared responsibilities and requirements for building and maintaining HIPAA-compliant workflows in Segment.
