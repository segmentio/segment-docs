## Code Blocks

Analytics.js, our Javascript `library`, is the most powerful way to track customer data from your `website`. If you're just starting out, we recommend it over server-side libraries as the simplest installation for any website.

```js
analytics.identify('025pikachu025', {
  email: 'peekAtMe@email.poke',
  name: 'Pikachu'
  }, {
  integrations: {
    'All': false,
    'Intercom': true,
    'Google Analytics': true,
  }
});
```

{% codeexample %}
{% codeexampletab JavaScript %}
```js
console.log('example');
```
{% endcodeexampletab %}

{% codeexampletab HTML %}
```html
<div id="example"></div>
```
{% endcodeexampletab %}

{% codeexampletab CSS %}
```css
#example { color: red; }
```
{% endcodeexampletab %}
{% endcodeexample %}

## Notes

> note ""
> **NOTE:** Our [browser and mobile libraries](https://segment.com) **automatically** use Anonymous IDs under the covers to keep track of users as they navigate around your website or app, so you don't need to worry about them when using those libraries.

> note "Server-side tracking"
> Server-side data management is when tag sends data into your web server, then your web server passes that data to the destination system/server. [Find out more](https://segment.com)
