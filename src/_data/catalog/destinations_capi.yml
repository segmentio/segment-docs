      in-app message icons. By default, Braze will automatically load
      FontAwesome from
      https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/font-awesome/4.3.0/css/font-awesome.min.css.
      To disable this behavior (e.g. because your site uses a customized version
      of FontAwesome), set this option to true. Note that if you do this, you
      are responsible for ensuring that FontAwesome is loaded on your site -
      otherwise in-app messages may not render correctly. **This setting is only
      applicable if you are using version 2 of the Braze Web SDK.**

      Braze's Segment integration automatically registers every activity.
      However, if you would like to manually register activities, you may do so
      by disabling this setting. For more information, see the Braze
      [documentation](https://www.braze.com/docs/developer_guide/platform_integration_guides/android/in-app_messaging/integration/#step-1-braze-in-app-message-manager-registration).

      integration sends the same event for `Order Completed`. Klaviyo does not
      treat the event names differently in their backend feature wise. This
      option was introduced to bridge the existing disparity between our client
      and server side integration regarding how this event name is sent without
      forcibly breaking the current behavior.

      QuanticMind only accepts numbered events like `event1` and `event12`. When
      you `analytics.track(event, properties)` an event, we need to map that
      event name to QuanticMind numbered event. Enter an event on the left, and
      the QuanticMind event number you want on the right. [Contact

      this setting to override that behavior or to use multiple lookup fields.
      Simply input the name of the Segment trait on the left and the
      corresponding SFDC Field name on the right. If it is a custom field, be
