      When enabled, this will send the time the event was created to Adjust
      using unix timestamp formatting. Increased rejections are caused by
      [Adjust's requirement][1] that events are received in chronological order
      (Segment does not guarantee chronological order).

      When disabled, the created_at time will be the time an event is received
      by Adjust.

      **Facebook Recommended Events**


      The most important events that can help advertisers improve campaign ROI
      are the conversion events or events closest to the conversion. Those
      events are marked with an *.


      In addition, there are special requirements for dynamic ads. These events
      are marked with "m" for dynamic ads for mobile, and "t" for dynamic ads
      for travel.

      choose not to use it), the only exception being that we will automatically
      send `_eventName` to ensure all events are valid. Top-level properties
      will be mapped exactly. (For example, if you allowlist `someProp` then we
      will send `someProp`'s value). We otherwise make the following conversions
      for Facebook-spec'd events. Use the value on the `right-hand` side if you

      traits or `analytics.track('event', properties)` with custom properties,
      you need to map those traits and properties to Google Analytics custom

      name on the left. Choose the Google Analytics dimension you want on the

      If you are sending `.identify()` calls from your server side libraries or
      have Segment Cloud Apps that send back `.identify()` calls with enriched
      user traits, you can send that data to your GA account via custom
      dimensions and metrics. Unlike the client side integration which has the
      luxury of browsers and the global window `ga` tracker, for server side we
      will check your `traits` and your settings for custom dimension/metric
      mappings and send it with an explicit event.

      Because Google Analytics cannot accept arbitrary data about users or
      events, when you use `analytics.identify(userId, traits)` with custom
      numerical traits or `analytics.track('event', properties)` with custom
      numerical properties, you need to map those traits and properties to
      Google Analytics custom metrics if you want them to be sent to GA. Enter a
      trait or property name on the left. Choose the Google Analytics metric you
      want on the right. Google Analytics only accepts numbered metrics (e.g.
      metric3). We suggest using user-scoped metrics for trait mappings and
      hit-scoped metrics for properties. [Contact

      Google Analytics allows users to either pass custom dimensions / metrics

      subsequent events on that page. You can disable this functionality with
      this setting. If disabled, Segment will only pass custom dimensions /

      will only set a custom attribute `id` and only set $email as the primary
      identifier with your `traits.email` or `properties.email`.

      keep this setting enabled so that both client and server side Klaviyo

      treat the event names differently in their backend feature wise. This

      This setting allows you to provide mappings between traits in Segment
      identify events and the SFDC fields you would like us to lookup a Lead
      with. By default, the integration will look for an email trait in the
      identify event and will either create or update a lead in Salesforce based
      on whether one already exists with that given email address. You can use
      this setting to override that behavior or to use multiple lookup fields.
      Simply input the name of the Segment trait on the left and the
      corresponding SFDC Field name on the right. If it is a custom field, be
      sure to append it with __c. If you would like to use email in conjuction
      with another field **you need to explicitly define that as a row in this
      setting**.
