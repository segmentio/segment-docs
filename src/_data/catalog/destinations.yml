      will still be sent as Custom Events.



      **Facebook Recommended Events**


      The most important events that can help advertisers improve campaign ROI
      are the conversion events or events closest to the conversion. Those
      events are marked with an *.


      In addition, there are special requirements for dynamic ads. These events
      are marked with "m" for dynamic ads for mobile, and "t" for dynamic ads
      for travel.

      will send `someProp`'s value). We otherwise make the following conversions
      for Facebook-spec'd events. Use the value on the `right-hand` side if you

      Google Analytics allows users to either pass custom dimensions / metrics
      as properties of specific events or as properties for all events on a
      given page (or the lifetime of the global tracker object). The default
      Segment behavior is the latter. Any metrics / dimensions that are mapped
      to a given property will be set to the page and sent as properties of all
      subsequent events on that page. You can disable this functionality with
      this setting. If disabled, Segment will only pass custom dimensions /
      metrics as part of the payload of the event with which they are explicitly
      associated. Please reference the Google Analytics
      [documentation](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/analyticsjs/custom-dims-mets#implementation)

      This flag determines whether someone is sent an email with a confirmation

      This option is enabled by default to ensure duplicate profiles are not
      being created inside of Klaviyo. When enabled, we will never set $id field
      to your `userId` when you call `.identify()` or `.track()`. Instead, we
      will only set a custom attribute `id` and only set $email as the primary
      identifier with your `traits.email` or `properties.email`. 


      Klaviyo will not record events/profiles if there isn’t an email address
      associated with that customer.

      Impact is fewer events/profiles recorded in Klaviyo as a result.

      result in superfluous user profiles in Klaviyo and is generally not

      Enable this setting if you'd like to send `Order Completed` events as is
      rather than changing the event name to `Placed Order` on the server side
      (client side always sends Order Completed). It is recommended that you
      keep this setting enabled so that both client and server side Klaviyo
      integration sends the same event for `Order Completed`. Klaviyo does not
      treat the event names differently in their backend feature wise. This
      option was introduced to bridge the existing disparity between our client
      and server side integration regarding how this event name is sent without
      forcibly breaking the current behavior.

      this setting to override that behavior or to use multiple lookup fields.

      corresponding SFDC Field name on the right. If it is a custom field, be
