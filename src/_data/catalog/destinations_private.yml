          Please choose which version of the Pardot API you are using. If you
          are unsure, please reference this
          [guide](http://developer.pardot.com/kb/api-version-4/) to verify. If
          your account **allows** multiple prospects with the same email
          address, you are using version 4. Otherwise, you are using version 3.
          **Important:** If you are selecting version 4, please read our
          [documentation](https://segment.com/docs/connections/destinations/catalog/pardot)
          thoroughly before proceeding.

          prospects with. The Field Id cannot be `id` or `fid` as these are
          reserved keywords in the Pardot API. Needs to be case sensitive.
          **Important:** this option is only applicable if you are using version
          4 of the Pardot API. If you are using V4 of the API but plan on
          passing a `SalesforceFID` or `PardotID` as a property of an `identify`
          event, you can also ignore this setting. Please see our

          This setting allows you to provide mappings between traits in Segment
          identify events and the SFDC fields you would like us to lookup a Lead
          with. By default, the integration will look for an email trait in the
          identify event and will either create or update a lead in Salesforce
          based on whether one already exists with that given email address. You
          can use this setting to override that behavior or to use multiple
          lookup fields. Simply input the name of the Segment trait on the left
          and the corresponding SFDC Field name on the right. If it is a custom
          field, be sure to append it with __c. If you would like to use email
          in conjuction with another field **you need to explicitly define that
