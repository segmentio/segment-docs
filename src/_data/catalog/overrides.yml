      campaign that lead to the conversion. You can learn more about these
      events [here](https://segment.com/docs/spec/mobile/#install-attributed).

      With the update to use analytics-ios v4.x SDK if adTrackingEnabled is set

      failures in this scenario enable this setting to set the IDFA to be zero'd
      out (ie. '00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000') when sent to Google
      Adwords.
