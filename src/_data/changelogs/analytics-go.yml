- version: Fix vendor packages
  url: https://github.com/segmentio/analytics-go/releases/tag/v3.0.1
  date: '2018-10-02T19:08:56Z'
  notes: >-
    analytics-go was failing to install correctly using vendored packages due to
    its use of git submodules. We've replaced the git submodules with proper
    Golang vendoring to fix this issue. In addition, we've updated some internal
    tooling for the library itself, namely our circle builds and adding a test
    CLI.
- version: v3.0.0
  url: https://github.com/segmentio/analytics-go/releases/tag/v3.0.0
  date: '2018-08-28T22:16:11Z'
  notes: "v3 is a rewrite of our v2 version of the Go Library. We recommend using v3 as it supports many new features, has significant design improvements and is better tested.\r\n\r\nDocumentation on migrating from v2 to v3 is available at https://segment.com/docs/sources/server/go/#migrating-from-v2.\r\n\r\nThis release is the same as https://github.com/segmentio/analytics-go/releases/tag/3.0.0, but has the `v` prefix to work with [Go modules](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Modules). See https://github.com/segmentio/analytics-go/issues/134."
