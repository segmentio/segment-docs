title: "Will deleting my account cancel my subscription?"
---

No, deleting your account will only stop you from accessing workspaces through your login. The workspace is where the subscription is managed, and it will not be deleted. Data will still flow into Segment and your Destinations and you will still be charged if you delete your account but donâ€™t delete your workspace.

To fully delete your account, first delete your workspace, then delete your account.
