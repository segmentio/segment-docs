title: "Why canâ€™t I add the integration I want?"
---

Only users on our legacy API based plans will run into integration limits. Some of our older plans placed limitations on the integrations you could use.

If you would like to add an integration that is not available on your current plan please move to a new Team plan where all integrations are included along with several other additional features.
