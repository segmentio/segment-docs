## What is Segment?

> If you read the [detailed explanation of Segment] on the previous page, you can skip ahead!

Segment is a system for sending messages from your websites, mobile apps, and servers. These messages contain data about events on, or users of those systems, and these messages can sent on to other tools, and gathered together in a warehouse for later analysis. Segment can also bring in information about your users from external systems, such as helpdesks or CRM systems, and collate that information to help you analyze your data, build audiences of users, and personalize your users' experiences.

## The Workspace Administrator's Role

You don't have to be a developer to be a Workspace administrator for an organization, and this guide only covers tasks specifically related to managing a Workspace in the [Segment App](/docs/segment-app/).

However, many Workspace admins are also involved in the [Segment implementation process](/docs/guides/intro-impl/) as there are usually some tasks that must be performed in the Workspace to complete an implementation. If you think you might be developing a Segment implementation or helping out other developers, it's a good idea to read up about the Segment architecture and implementation process.

In addition, Workspace administrators set up and maintain the organization's workspace settings, which include:
- billing contacts
- incident contacts
- the Workspace name

They may also maintain:
- organization authentication settings: logins, TFA, SAML, OAuth, etc
- Access Management settings - IAM, environments, roles, permissions model, groups, labels
- environments and labels
- Security settings
