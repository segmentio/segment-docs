## What is a billing cycle?

On the Segment monthly Team plan, your billing cycle starts the day after your 14-day trial ends. You're billed on this day for each month while you're on this plan. 

On the Segment annual Team plan, you're billed at the end of your 14-day trial for the amount of an entire year of service including a specific number of [MTUs](/docs/guides/usage-and-billing/mtus-and-throughput#what-is-an-mtu). Annual plan subscribers are billed for MTU overages at the end of each monthly cycle.


## How do I change my plan?

If you already have a Segment workspace, you can change which plan your workspace is on by navigating to **Settings > Usage & Billing > Plans**.

_If you cancel or downgrade your plan during the 2-week trial period, you don't incur any charges._

### What if I cancel my paid plan before the end of the month?

#### Cancellation on the monthly Team plan

If you cancel your plan or downgrade to a free account before the end of your official billing period on the monthly Team plan, you'll receive a final bill for the prorated amount for the $120 base + a charge for any MTUs you've used over the allotted 10,000 at the rates posted on the [pricing page](https://segment.com/pricing).

#### Cancellation on the annual Team plan

Segment doesn't issue refunds for the pre-paid portion of your annual bill after your trial ends.

Be aware that if you notify Segment of wanting to cancel your annual plan, but continue to send data to Segment's servers, you may incur overage charges in any given month. You should fully delete your workspace or cycle your write keys to stop all data flow into Segment to avoid future charges.


## Will Segment charge sales tax on my invoice?

All Segment customers with a US business address may be subject to state and local sales taxes. The applicable tax law applies based on your business location address, which may be different from your billing address. Customers who purchase a taxable product or service, and are located in a jurisdiction where Segment currently charges sales tax, will see the calculated sales tax on their invoice.

Segment currently charges sales tax in the these states:

- Arizona
- Colorado (Denver only)
- Connecticut
- District of Columbia
- Illinois (Chicago only)
- Massachusetts
- New York
- Ohio
- Pennsylvania
- South Carolina
- Tennessee
- Texas
- Utah
- Washington

## Do I qualify for a tax exemption?

If you believe your organization qualifies for a sales tax exemption (for example, because of a nonprofit or government status), you can contact [tax@segment.com](mailto:tax@segment.com) with the appropriate form.

### I submitted a form for tax exemption, why am I still charged sales tax?

Tax might still be charged on your bill if either:

- The exemption certificate was still in review while the invoice was issued; or
- The exemption certificate covers a state that is different from the billing address


## Do you offer refunds?

In most cases Segment doesn't offer refunds, as noted in the [Terms of Service](https://segment.com/legal/terms/). [Contact support](https://segment.com/help/contact) if you feel that you're in a unique situation.

## Is there a free trial for paid plans?

Yes! Segment offers a _**2-week trial on the Team plan**_ to let you try the plan before you purchase it! 

Segment also offers the Free plan, which includes up to 1,000 MTUs, at no cost to you. 

Find out more about the [different plans](https://segment.com/pricing) and which one suits your needs best.  

## What happens when I exceed the Free plan limit?

The Free plan includes up to 1,000 MTUs at no cost. If you exceed the 1,000 MTU limit once in a 6-month period, Segment locks your account but data is still able to flow through Segment. To unlock your account, you can choose from these options:
* **Option 1**: Wait for a full billing cycle (1 month) to go by with any overages. This will automatically unlock your account if the MTU numbers are able to go back down on their own.
* **Option 2**: Upgrade to the [Team plan](https://segment.com/pricing/). This starts a 2-week free trial that gives you 14 days to fix your implementation to decrease the traffic.

If you exceed the 1,000 MTU limit twice in a 6-month period, Segment locks your account and also stops sending and receiving data. You can unlock your account by following option 2 above to upgrade to the [Team plan](https://segment.com/pricing/) 2-week free trial. 

## Team Trial FAQ

**What is the Team trial?**

The Team trial is a 14-day free trial of Segment's [Team plan](https://segment.com/pricing), and it includes all the features associated with a Team plan, including unlimited sources, two warehouse syncs per day, 10 seats, and 10,000 MTUs (with the ability to track more MTUs as needed).

**How do I get a two-week Team trial?**

You automatically receive a 2-week trial when you sign up for a Team plan. 

**Do I have to be a "new" customer to receive the free Team trial?**

The free trial is available to all customers who have never had a Team plan. This includes new customers as well as customers who have previously been on the Free plan. 

**Do you have to include your payment information when signing up for a Team trial?**

If you're upgrading from a Free Plan to a Team Plan, you're required to add your payment information. 

If you're signing up for a new Team plan, you don't have to add your payment information during sign up. If you would like to continue to use the Team plan after the 14-day trial, add your credit card information on the "Payment Information" page in your workspace before the trial ends. 

**What happens when the two-week trial ends?**

If you added your payment information, your subscription automatically continues at the regular rate after the trial period expires. You can [delete your workspace](/docs/guides/usage-and-billing/account-management/#how-do-i-delete-my-workspace-entirely) or [downgrade to a Free plan](#how-do-i-change-my-plan) any time during the trial to avoid charges.

To activate the free trial, add your payment information.
