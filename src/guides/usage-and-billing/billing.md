## What is a billing cycle?

On our monthly Team plan, your billing cycle will start the day after your 14-day trial ends. You will be billed on this day each month going forward. 

On our annual Team plan, you will be billed at the end of your 14-day trail for the sum of the entire year of service at a certain number of MTU. All overages for annual plans are billed at the end of your monthly billing cycle.


## How do I change my plan?

If you already have a Segment workspace, you can change which plan your workspace is on by navigating to the "Usage & Billing" menu, then finding the "Plans" page. You can select your new plan on the "Plans" page.

_If you cancel or downgrade your workspace within your 2-week trial period, you will not incur any charges._

**What if I cancel my workspace before the end of the month?**

**_Cancellation on the Monthly Team Plan_**

If you cancel your workspace or downgrade to a free developer account before the end of your official billing period on the monthly team plan, you will receive a final bill consisting of a prorated amount for the $120 base + a charge for any MTUs you have used over the allotted 10,000 at the rates posted on our [pricing page](https://segment.com/pricing).

_**Cancellation on the Annual Team Plan**_

We do not issue refunds for the pre-paid portion of your annual bill after your trial has ended.

Please be aware that if you notify us that you want to cancel your annual plan, but continue to send data to our servers, you may incur overage charges in any given month. Please fully delete your workspace or cycle your write keys to stop all data flow into Segment and avoid future charges.


## Why are you applying US sales tax to my invoice?

Segment began collection of US Sales Tax on taxable sales to customer based on new tax laws. US sales tax is only applied to invoices addressed to paying customers based on the states listed below, containing purchases of taxable Segment products.

Please contact us with your exemption documentation if you are eligible to claim a sales tax exemption in relation to your existing invoice(s). 

**Current states:**

*   Texas


## Do you offer refunds?

In most cases we do not offer refunds, as noted in our [Terms of Service](https://segment.com/docs/legal/terms/). Please [reach out to support](https://segment.com/help/contact) if you feel that you are in a unique situation.

## Is there a free trial for paid plans?

Yes! We offer a _**two-week trial on the Team plan**_ to let you try the plan before you purchase it! 

We also offer the Developer plan, which includes up to 1,000 MTUs, at no cost to you.

## Team Trial FAQ

**What is the Team trial?**

The Team trial is a 14-day free trial of Segment's [Team plan](https://segment.com/pricing), and it includes all the features associated with a Team plan, including unlimited sources, two warehouse syncs per day, 10 seats, and 10,000 MTUs (with the ability to track more MTUs as needed).

**How do I get a two-week Team trial?**

You automatically receive a two week trial when you sign up for a Team plan. 

**Do I have to be a "new" customer to receive the free Team trial?**

The free trial is available to all customers who have never had a Team plan. This includes new customers as well as customers who have previously been on the Developer plan. 

**Do you have to include your payment information when signing up for a Team trial?**

If you're upgrading from a Developer plan, you are required to add your payment information. 

If you are signing up for a new Team plan, you do not have to add your payment information during sign up. However, if you would like to continue to use the Team plan after the 14 day trial, please add your credit card information on the "Payment Information" page in your workspace before the trial ends. 

**What happens when the two week trial ends?**

If you added your payment information, your subscription will automatically continue at the regular rate after the trail period expires. You can [delete your workspace](https://segment.com/docs/guides/account-management/how-do-i-delete-my-workspace-entirely/) or [downgrade](https://segment.com/docs/guides/usage-and-billing/what-if-i-cancel-my-workspace-before-the-end-of-a-month-on-the-monthly-plan-will-i-get-a-final-bill/) to the free Developer plan anytime during the trial if you don't want to be charged.

If you have not added your payment information, we will ask that you add your payment information during your two week trial.
