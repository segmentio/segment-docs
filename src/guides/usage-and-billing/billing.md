## What is a billing cycle?

On the Segment monthly Team plan, your billing cycle starts the day after your 14-day trial ends. You are billed on this day for each month while you are on this plan. 

On the Segment annual Team plan, you are billed at the end of your 14-day trail for the amount for an entire year of service including a specific number of MTUs. Annual plan subscribers are billed for MTU overages at the end of each monthly cycle.


## How do I change my plan?

If you already have a Segment workspace, you can change which plan your workspace is on by navigating to the "Usage & Billing" menu, then finding the "Plans" page. You can select a different plan from the "Plans" page.

_If you cancel or downgrade your plan during the two-week trial period, you do not incur any charges._

### What if I cancel my paid plan before the end of the month?

#### Cancellation on the Monthly Team Plan

If you cancel your plan or downgrade to a free account before the end of your official billing period on the monthly team plan, you will receive a final bill for the prorated amount for the $120 base + a charge for any MTUs you have used over the allotted 10,000 at the rates posted on our [pricing page](https://segment.com/pricing).

#### Cancellation on the Annual Team Plan

We do not issue refunds for the pre-paid portion of your annual bill after your trial has ended.

Be aware that if you notify us that you want to cancel your annual plan, but continue to send data to our servers, you may incur overage charges in any given month. You should fully delete your workspace or cycle your write keys to stop all data flow into Segment and avoid future charges.


## Will Segment charge sales tax on my invoice?

All Segment customers with a US business address may be subject to state and local sales taxes. The applicable tax law will be applied based on your business location address, which may be different from your billing address. Customers who purchase a taxable product or service, and are located in a jurisdiction where Segment currently charges sales tax, will see the calculated sales tax on their invoice.

Segment currently charges sales tax in the following states:

- Arizona
- Chicago
- Connecticut
- Denver
- District of Columbia
- Massachusetts
- New York
- Ohio
- Pennsylvania
- South Carolina
- Tennessee
- Texas
- Utah
- Washington

## Do I qualify for a tax exemption?

If you believe your organization qualifies for a sales tax exemption (for example, because of a nonprofit or government status), you can contact [tax@segment.com](mailto:tax@segment.com) with the appropriate form.

### I submitted a form for tax exemption, why am I still being charged sales tax?

Tax might still be charged on your bill if either:

- The exemption certificate was still in review while the invoice was issued; or
- The exemption certificate covers a state that is different from the billing address


## Do you offer refunds?

In most cases we do not offer refunds, as noted in our [Terms of Service](https://segment.com/legal/terms/). [Contact support](https://segment.com/help/contact) if you feel that you are in a unique situation.

## Is there a free trial for paid plans?

Yes! We offer a _**two-week trial on the Team plan**_ to let you try the plan before you purchase it! 

We also offer the Free plan, which includes up to 1,000 MTUs, at no cost to you.

## Team Trial FAQ

**What is the Team trial?**

The Team trial is a 14-day free trial of Segment's [Team plan](https://segment.com/pricing), and it includes all the features associated with a Team plan, including unlimited sources, two warehouse syncs per day, 10 seats, and 10,000 MTUs (with the ability to track more MTUs as needed).

**How do I get a two-week Team trial?**

You automatically receive a two week trial when you sign up for a Team plan. 

**Do I have to be a "new" customer to receive the free Team trial?**

The free trial is available to all customers who have never had a Team plan. This includes new customers as well as customers who have previously been on the Free plan. 

**Do you have to include your payment information when signing up for a Team trial?**

If you're upgrading from a Free Plan to a Team Plan, you are required to add your payment information. 

If you are signing up for a new Team plan, you do not have to add your payment information during sign up. However, if you would like to continue to use the Team plan after the 14 day trial, add your credit card information on the "Payment Information" page in your workspace before the trial ends. 

**What happens when the two week trial ends?**

If you added your payment information, your subscription automatically continues at the regular rate after the trial period expires. You can [delete your workspace](/docs/guides/usage-and-billing/account-management/#how-do-i-delete-my-workspace-entirely) or [downgrade to a Free plan](/docs/guides/usage-and-billing/billing/#how-do-i-change-my-plan) any time during the trial if you don't want to be charged.

To activate the free trial we ask that you add your payment information (if you have already done so).
