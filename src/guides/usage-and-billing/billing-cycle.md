title: "What is a billing cycle?"
---

On our monthly Team plan, your billing cycle will start the day after your 14-day trial ends. You will be billed on this day each month going forward.Â 

On our annual Team plan, you will be billed at the end of your 14-day trail for the sum of the entire year of service at a certain number of MTU. All overages for annual plans are billed at the end of your monthly billing cycle.
