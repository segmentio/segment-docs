title: How do we set up event-triggered notifications or alerts?
---

Below you'll find a bunch of ways to setup notifications for yourself based on the data you're sending through Segment. 

### Google Analytics custom alerts

You can use Google Analytics Custom Alerts to send yourself emails whenever a specific traffic segment drops below (or above) a threshold you set. 

[Details on how to set that up can be found here](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/1033021?hl=en)

### Analytics email summaries

In tools like Amplitude, KISSmetrics, Mixpanel you can setup email reports delivered to you on a daily basis. They are completely customizable, so you can keep an eye on as many events or other metrics you'd like.

### Realtime Traffic Monitoring

Chartbeat and GoSquared both offer awesome real-time dashboards to see what's happening right now on your site. They both include the option to get notified when your traffic hits a certain threshold. For example, if your on-site visitors is less than 100 people, or more than 1,000.

*   [GoSquared Traffic Spike Alerts](https://www.gosquared.com/customer/portal/articles/1036771-traffic-spike-alerts)

Note: GoSquared also offers in-depth historical and user analysis. Chartbeat sticks to realtime anonymous traffic, but offers some sweet features for publishers.

### Webhook-based Alerts

The last option we recommend is to use a monitoring tool like [PagerDuty](https://www.pagerduty.com/) or [Data Dog](https://www.datadoghq.com/) and point our [webhooks](/docs/destinations/webhooks) destination at them. That way you can setup custom alerts in their system.

### Event-Triggered Emails

The last option for alerting based off of Segment events is to use one of the email tools available on the Segment platform that offers event-triggered emails. Your options there are Customer.io, Vero, Autopilot, Outbound, Klaviyo, or Threads.
