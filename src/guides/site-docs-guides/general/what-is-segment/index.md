title: "What is Segment?"
---

Segment is a single platform that collects, stores, and routes your user data to hundreds of tools with the flick of a switch.

We take care of the messy analytics installation process for you, so you can spend more time using your data and less time tracking it down.

## Why Do I Need Segment?

Segment saves engineers months spent installing and maintaining analytics tools, gives marketers the agility to try new tools and test campaigns quickly, and enables BI teams to export their raw data into internal systems and - databases.

## How Does it Work?

Analytics, marketing automation, email, user testing, error reporting, and support tools all require the same data: who are your users and what are they doing.

Without Segment, you have to instrument each tool separately, even though you send them all the same data. Segment eliminates this extra code and replaces the tool installation process.

You just send your data to us, then we translate and route it to all of your tools.

Use the Segment API to track user events like page views, clicks, and sign ups on your mobile app and website. Next switch on marketing, product, and analytics tools you want to use in Segment's control panel. Then Segment:

*   Collects and stores your data in one place
*   Prepares and translates the data into a format each tool understands
*   Sends the data to your designated tools, so you never have to install tracking again

## What's an example?

A multinational music streaming service needs to track when users play songs, create stations, and upgrade their accounts, so the company can see how free customers are converting and identify the most popular artists to promote.

Previously, they needed to code the same events like "Played Song" slightly differently for every tool they wanted to use, on repeat for every page of their website and mobile app. Now, they use Segment for all their tracking needs. They track these events once with the Segment API, and then we translate and send the data streams to whatever analytics tools they turn on in our control panel.

Voilà! Their customer data populates in tools like Amplitude and Google Analytics. Their marketing team can reach out to people that play songs daily but haven't upgraded their accounts, and the product team can see how new features are faring to optimize accordingly.
