## What is Segment?

Segment is a system for sending messages from your websites, mobile apps, and servers. These messages contain data about events on, or users of those systems, and these messages can sent on to other tools, and gathered together in a warehouse for later analysis. Segment can also bring in information about your users from external systems, such as helpdesks or CRM systems, and collate that information to help you analyze your data, build audiences of users, and personalize your users' experiences.

Once you (or your organizations' developer teams) have data flowing from Segment Sources, you can hook these sources up to other tools (like Google Analytics, Mixpanel, and many others), which are called Destinations.
