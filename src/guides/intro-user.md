If you aren't involved in setting up your Segment implementation, or are just starting to set up Destinations for your organization's workspace, this guide is for you.

## What is Segment?

Segment is a system for sending messages from your websites, mobile apps, and servers. These messages contain data about events on, or users of those systems, and these messages can sent on to other tools, and gathered together in a warehouse for later analysis. Segment can also bring in information about your users from external systems, such as helpdesks or CRM systems, and collate that information to help you analyze your data, build audiences of users, and personalize your users' experiences.

Once you (or your organizations' developer teams) have your Segment Sources set up and sending data, you can log in to the Segment app and set up Destinations, so that Segment sends that data to other tools (like Google Analytics, Mixpanel, and many others).

## Set up a Destination

Depending on the access level you have in your organization's Segment workspace, you might be able to create new Destinations, or you might only be able to edit existing ones.

To add a new Destination, you'll usually need some information from the destination tool, which you enter into the Segment App so Segment can send data to that tool.
