### Good to know
The {{ page.title }} is an **event** source. This means that it sends data as events, which are behaviors or occurences tied to a user and a point in time. Data from these sources can be loaded into your Segment warehouses, and **also** sent to  Segment streaming destinations. [Learn more about cloud sources.](/docs/connections/sources/)
