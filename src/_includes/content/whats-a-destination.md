Destinations are business tools or apps that you can connect to the data flowing through Segment. Some of our most popular destinations are Google Analytics, Mixpanel, Kissmetrics, Customer.io, Intercom, and KeenIO.

All of these tools run on the same data: who are your customers and what are they doing? But each tool requires that you send that data in a slightly different format, which means that you'd have to write code to track all of this information, again and again, for each tool, on each page of your app or website.

Enter Segment. Do it once!

We eliminate this process by introducing an abstraction layer. You send your data to us, and we understand how to translate it so we can send it along to any destination. You enable destinations from the catalog in the Segment App, and user data immediately starts flowing into those tools. No extra code required!

We support many categories of destinations, from advertising to marketing, email to customer support, CRM to user testing, and even data warehouses. You can view a complete list of our [destinations](/docs/connections/destinations/catalog/) or check out our [destination page](https://segment.com/destinations) for a searchable list broken down by category.
