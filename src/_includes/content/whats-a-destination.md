Destinations are business tools or apps that you can connect to the data flowing through Segment. Some of Segment's most popular destinations are Google Analytics, Mixpanel, Kissmetrics, Customer.io, Intercom, and KeenIO.

All of these tools run on the same data: who are your customers and what are they doing? But each tool requires that you send that data in a slightly different format, which means that you'd have to write code to track all of this information, again and again, for each tool, on each page of your app or website.

Enter Segment. Do it once.

Segment eliminates this process by introducing an abstraction layer. You send your data to Segment, and Segment understands how to translate it so we can send it along to any destination. You enable destinations from the catalog in the Segment App, and user data immediately starts flowing into those tools. No extra code required!

Segment supports many categories of destinations, from advertising to marketing, email to customer support, CRM to user testing, and even data warehouses. You can view a complete list of available [destinations](/docs/connections/destinations/catalog/) or check out the [destination page](/docs/connections/destinations/) for a searchable list broken down by category.
