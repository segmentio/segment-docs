A workspace is a group of sources that can be administered and billed together. Workspaces let you collaborate with team members, add permissions, and share sources across your whole team using a shared billing account.

Workspaces help companies manage access for multiple users and data sources. When you are logged in to your Segment account, you can create a new workspace from the menu.
