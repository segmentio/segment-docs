A workspace is a group of sources that can be administered and billed together. Workspaces help companies manage access for multiple users and data sources. Workspaces let you collaborate with team members, add permissions, and share sources across your whole team using a shared billing account.

 When you first log in to your Segment account, you can choose to log into an existing workspace if your account is part of an existing organization, or create a new workspace.
