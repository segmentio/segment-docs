Your data will be available in Warehouses between 24 and 48 hours from your first sync. Your warehouse then syncs once, or twice a day depending on your [Segment Plan](segment.com/pricing).

Segment allows Business Tier (BT) customers to schedule the time and frequency of warehouse data syncs.

If you are on a BT plan, you can schedule warehouse syncs by going to **Warehouse > Settings > Sync Schedule** in the Segment web app. You can schedule up to the number of syncs allowed on your billing plan.
