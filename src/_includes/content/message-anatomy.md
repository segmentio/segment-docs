The most basic Segment message requires only a `userID` or `anonymousID`; all other fields are optional to allow for maximum flexibility. However, a normal Segment message has three main parts: the [common fields](/docs/connections/spec/common/), the ["context" object](/docs/connections/spec/common#context), and the properties (if it's an event) or traits (if it's an object).

The common fields include information specific to how the call was generated, like the timestamp and library name and version. The fields in the context object are usually generated by the library, and include information about the environment in which the call was generated: page path, user agent, OS, locale settings, etc. The properties and traits are optional and are where you customize the information you want to collect for your implementation.

Another common part of a Segment message is [the `integrations` object](/docs/guides/filtering-data/#filtering-with-the-integrations-object), which you can use to explicitly filter which destinations the call is forwarded to. However this object is optional, and is often omitted in favor of non-code based filtering options.
