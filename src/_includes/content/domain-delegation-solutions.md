## Segment's domain delegation solutions

Segment offers two domain delegation solutions: [Custom Proxy](/docs/connections/sources/catalog/libraries/website/javascript/custom-proxy) and [Custom Domain](/docs/connections/sources/custom-domain). If you use Custom Domain, you can choose to use either DNS delegation or a Cannonical Name (CNAME). Segment recommends using Custom Domain with DNS delegation, which leads to easy setup, maintenance, and monitoring. 

| Service | How it works | Infrastructure management | Availability |
| ------- | ------------ | ------------------------- | ------------ |
| Custom Domain with DNS Delegation | A Segment service that allows your website to use your own subdomain to load Analytics.js securely over HTTPS and send event data. It is not limited to Analytics.js and is also compatible with server libraries. It uses a DNS subdomain that you delegate to Segment.<sup>*</sup> | **Segment manages all related infrastructure**, including applying security updates, managing the SSL certificate lifecycle, and monitoring. | Business Tier <br><br> Recommended for reliable data collection. |
| Custom Domain with CNAME | This approach uses a Canonical Name (CNAME) to map an alias name on your domain name to Analytics.js. It is not limited to Analytics.js and is also compatible with server libraries. | Customers are responsible for maintaining CNAME. | Business Tier <br><br> Not recommended due to evolving and persistent browser privacy measures. |  
| Custom Proxy | This approach uses a proxy or wrapper where all data is first collected by a proxy on your domain and then forwarded to Segment. | Customers are responsible for maintaining their own proxy infrastructure. | Available to all Segment users. <br><br> Not recommended because it adds a point of failure, but remains an option if Custom Domain with sub-domain delegation is unavailable to you. | 

<sup>*</sup>_If it's not possible for you to delegate subdomains to Segment, you can use a CNAME instead. Segment encourages users to delegate a DNS subdomain rather than use use CNAME aliasing due to the evolving privacy standards in browsers, but CNAME aliasing remains an option for users not interested in using nameservers._
