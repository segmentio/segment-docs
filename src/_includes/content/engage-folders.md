## Organize with folders

Use folders to organize your Email, SMS/MMS, Push, and Whatsapp content templates. Group related content together to better help you manage and find your marketing resources.
 
From the Templates overview page you can create, update, view, and delete template folders.

To create a folder:

1. Navigate to **Engage > Content**.
2. Select the tab for the template type (Email, SMS, WhatsApp, or Push) you'd like to create the folder for. 
3. Click **Create**, then select **Folder**.
4. Add a folder name, then click **Create**. 

You can also rename, add templates, or disband your folder from the Templates overview page. Disbanding a folder returns all templates from the folder to the main template list, without deleting any of the templates.

### Move templates to your folders

From the Templates overview page, you can select individual template(s) to move to your folders. 

After you select the templates you'd like to move:
1. Click **Actions**, and select **Move Templates**.
2. Select the destination folder, then click **Move templates to folder**.

Use the **Actions** button in your folder to remove templates or move them to a different location. When you remove a template, Engage returns the template to the Templates overview page, without deleting it.
