On March 26, 2024, Segment is upgrading the Functions runtime environment to Node.js v18, which is the current long-term support (LTS) release.

This upgrade keeps your runtime current with industry standards. Based on the [AWS Lambda](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/lambda-runtimes.html){:target="_blank"} and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/about/previous-releases){:target="_blank"} support schedule, Node.js v16 is no longer in *Maintenance LTS*. Production applications should only use releases of Node.js that are in *Active LTS* or *Maintenance LTS*.

All new functions will use Node.js v18 starting March 26, 2024.

For existing functions, this change automatically occurs as you update and deploy an existing function. Segment recommends that you check your function post-deployment to ensure everything's working. Your function may face issues due to the change in sytax between different Node.js versions and dependency compatibility.

  <br> `uuidv5` is exposed as an object. Use `uuidv5.uuidv5` to access its functions. For example:

    ```js
    async function onRequest(request, settings) {
	     uuidv5 = uuidv5.uuidv5;
	     console.log(typeof uuidv5);

	      //Generate a UUID in the default URL namespace
	      var urlUUID = uuidv5('url', 'http://google/com/page');
	      console.log(urlUUID);

	      //Default DNS namespace
	      var dnsUUID = uuidv5('dns', 'google.com');
	      console.log(dnsUUID);
      }
    ```
  `zlib`'s asynchronous methods `inflate` and `deflate` must be used with `async` or `await`. For example:

    ```js
  zlib = zlib.zlib;  // Required to access zlib objects and associated functions
  async function onRequest(request, settings) {
    const body = request.json();

    const input = 'something';

    // Calling inflateSync method
    var deflated = zlib.deflateSync(input);

    console.log(deflated.toString('base64'));

    // Calling inflateSync method
    var inflated = zlib.inflateSync(new Buffer.from(deflated)).toString();

    console.log(inflated);

    console.log('Done');
    }
    ```

The following Node.js modules are available:
- [`crypto` Node.js module](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v10.x/docs/api/crypto.html ){:target="_blank"} exposed as `crypto`.
- [`https` Node.js module](https://nodejs.org/api/https.html){:target="_blank"} exposed as `https`.

[Other built-in Node.js modules](https://nodejs.org/api/modules.html){:target="_blank"} aren't available.

### Caching

Basic cache storage is available through the `cache` object, which has the following methods defined:

- `cache.load(key: string, ttl: number, fn: async () => any): Promise<any>`
  - Obtains a cached value for the provided `key`, invoking the callback if the value is missing or has expired. The `ttl` is the maximum duration in milliseconds the value can be cached. If omitted or set to `-1`, the value will have no expiry.
- `cache.delete(key: string): void`
  - Immediately remove the value associated with the `key`.

Some important notes about the cache:

- When testing functions in the code editor, the cache will be empty because each test temporarily deploys a new instance of the function.
- Values in the cache are not shared between concurrently-running function instances; they are process-local which means that high-volume functions will have many separate caches.
- Values may be expunged at any time, even before the configured TTL is reached. This can happen due to memory pressure or normal scaling activity. Minimizing the size of cached values can improve your hit/miss ratio.
- Functions that receive a low volume of traffic may be temporarily suspended, during which their caches will be emptied. In general, caches are best used for high-volume functions and with long TTLs.
The following example gets a JSON value through the cache, only invoking the callback as needed:

```js
const ttl = 5 * 60 * 1000 // 5 minutes
const val = await cache.load("mycachekey", ttl, async () => {
    const res = await fetch("http://echo.jsontest.com/key/value/one/two")
    const data = await res.json()
    return data
})
```
