Functions use Node.js 14.x.

Functions do not currently support importing dependencies, but you can [contact Segment Support](https://segment.com/help/contact/) to request that one be added.

The following dependencies are installed in the function environment by default.

- [`atob v2.1.2`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/atob) exposed as `atob`

    `zlib`'s asynchronous methods `inflate` and `deflate` must be used with `async` or `await`. For example:

    ```js
  zlib = zlib.zlib;  // Required to access zlib objects and associated functions
  async function onRequest(request, settings) {
    const body = request.json();

    const input = 'something';

    // Calling inflateSync method
    var deflated = zlib.deflateSync(input);

    console.log(deflated.toString('base64'));

    // Calling inflateSync method
    var inflated = zlib.inflateSync(new Buffer.from(deflated)).toString();

    console.log(inflated);

    console.log('Done');
    }
    ```

Only the [`crypto` Node.js module](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v10.x/docs/api/crypto.html ) is included (exposed as `crypto`). [Other built-in Node.js modules](https://nodejs.org/api/modules.html) are not available.

For more information on using the `aws-sdk` module, see how to [set up functions for calling AWS APIs](/docs/connections/functions/aws-apis/).

### Caching

Basic cache storage is available through the `cache` object, which has the following methods defined:

- `cache.load(key: string, ttl: number, fn: async () => any): Promise<any>`
  - Obtains a cached value for the provided `key`, invoking the callback if the value is missing or has expired. The `ttl` is the maximum duration in milliseconds the value can be cached. If omitted or set to `-1`, the value will have no expiry.
- `cache.delete(key: string): void`
  - Immediately remove the value associated with the `key`.

Some important notes about the cache:

- When testing functions in the code editor, the cache will be empty because each test temporarily deploys a new instance of the function.
- Values in the cache are not shared between concurrently-running function instances; they are process-local which means that high-volume functions will have many separate caches.
- Values may be expunged at any time, even before the configured TTL is reached. This can happen due to memory pressure or normal scaling activity. Minimizing the size of cached values can improve your hit/miss ratio.
- Functions that receive a low volume of traffic may be temporarily suspended, during which their caches will be emptied. In general, caches are best used for high-volume functions and with long TTLs.
The following example gets a JSON value through the cache, only invoking the callback as needed:

```js
const ttl = 5 * 60 * 1000 // 5 minutes
const val = await cache.load("mycachekey", ttl, async () => {
    const res = await fetch("http://echo.jsontest.com/key/value/one/two")
    const data = await res.json()
    return data
})
```
