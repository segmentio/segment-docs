Functions have specific roles which can be used for [access management](/docs/segment-app/iam/) in your Segment workspace.

Access to functions is controlled by two permissions [roles](/docs/segment-app/iam/roles/):

- **Functions Admin:** Create, edit and delete all functions, or a subset of specified functions.
- **Functions Read-only:** View all functions, or a subset of specified functions.

You also need additional **Source Admin** permissions to enable source functions, connect destination functions to a source, or to deploy changes to existing functions.
