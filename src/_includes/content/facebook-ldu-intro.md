In July 2020, Facebook released [Limited Data Use feature](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/marketing-apis/data-processing-options) to help businesses comply with the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). This feature limits the way user data is stored and processed for all California residents who opt out of the sale of their data. You can send Limited Data Use data processing parameters to Facebook on each event so that Facebook can appropriately apply the user's data choice. Segment recommends that you first familiarize yourself on this feature and the [Data Processing Options Facebook accepts](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/marketing-apis/data-processing-options).

This destination supports the following parameters:

* **Data Processing Options**
* **Data Processing Options Country**
* **Data Processing Options State**

You can enable the feature using the **Use Limited Data Use** destination setting and control it using Data Processing Initialization Parameters.
