### Segment Support Business Hours

Segmentâ€™s Support teams work standard business hours (roughly 9:00 AM to 5:30 PM, Monday through Friday) across the Pacific, GMT, and Australian Eastern time zones. Please note, however, that your specific support hours will be governed by the terms and conditions of your Agreement.

Saturdays, Sundays, and local holidays are not considered "standard business hours". On these days, our staffing may be limited, which could delay responses. Below you will find the list of Segment's observed holidays, along with the region in which observance takes place.
