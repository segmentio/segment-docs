title: What Should I track?
---

As the central hub for your customer data, we think it's important to give you the benefit of some hard-won best practices from our happiest and most successful customers.

This is one of those best practices:

**Analytics is overwhelming.** Lots of people think that tracking 73 different metrics means they've solved their analytics problem. _Don't do it!_ Unless you've got employees twiddling their thumbs, you'll never be able to handle that many metrics.

Our most successful and happiest customers, regardless of company size, _limit_ their tracking plan to a tight set of important events, with lots of properties that they can use to answer concrete business questions.

Here are some rules to follow when developing your tracking plan, to help keep it neat, tidy, and semantically useful:

- Don't create event names dynamically.
- Don't create events to track properties.
- Don't create property keys dynamically.
- Make sure every event helps you answer a question about your business.
- Start with your core customer lifecycle to construct your funnel.
- Only add events as you feel they're missing.
