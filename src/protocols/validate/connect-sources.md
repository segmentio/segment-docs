title: Connect a Tracking Plan
---

With your Tracking Plan is complete, it's time to apply the Tracking Plan to one or more Sources. Select **Connect Source** from the right hand menu for your specific Tracking Plan.

From this menu, you will be redirected to a workflow to select a Source from your workspace. Note that a Source can only have one tracking plan applied to it. You *can't* select a Source that already has a Tracking Plan connected to it, but you *can* apply a Tracking Plan to multiple sources.

After selecting a Source, you will be shown the consequences of connecting your Tracking Plan. In many cases, there will be no consequences. However, if you've enabled Schema Defaults, events previously allowed will now be blocked if they are not included in the Tracking Plan. If you've blocked specific events, those events will now be allowed until you enable Blocking in the Tracking Plan settings.

**IMPORTANT: Make sure to read through the consequences of connecting a source!**
