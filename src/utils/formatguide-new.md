## Headings

# Heading 1

The H1 heading size is equivalent to a title. Please don't use it in a page. Use the `title: ` frontmatter instead.

## Heading 2

H2s are programmatically recorded to form the table of contents in the right-nav.

### Heading 3

H3 is a nice, friendly heading without anything special.

#### Heading 4

H4 is good for making FAQs when you want the text a little bigger than its surrounding prose.

##### Heading 5

H5 is good for making FAQs when you want the text about the same size as the surrounding prose.

## Code Blocks

Analytics.js, our Javascript `library`, is the most powerful way to track customer data from your `website`. If you're just starting out, we recommend it over server-side libraries as the simplest installation for any website.

```js
analytics.identify('user_123', {
  email: 'jane.kim@example.com',
  name: 'Jane Kim'
  }, {
  integrations: {
    'All': false,
    'Intercom': true,
    'Google Analytics': true,
  }
});
```

## Code Blocks with tabs

{% codeexample %}
{% codeexampletab JavaScript %}
```js
console.log('example');
```
{% endcodeexampletab %}

{% codeexampletab HTML %}
```html
<div id="example"></div>
```
{% endcodeexampletab %}

{% codeexampletab CSS %}
```css
#example { color: red; }
```
{% endcodeexampletab %}
{% endcodeexample %}

## Notes

> note ""
> **NOTE:** Our [browser and mobile libraries](https://segment.com) **automatically** use Anonymous IDs under the covers to keep track of users as they navigate around your website or app, so you don't need to worry about them when using those libraries.

> note "Server-side tracking"
> Server-side data management is when tag sends data into your web server, then your web server passes that data to the destination system/server. [Find out more](https://segment.com)
