Segmentâ€™s alerting capabilities allow you to receive in-app, email, or Slack notifications related to the performance and throughput of a Segment connection. The notification channels that you select for one alert will apply to all alerts in your workspace.

> info "Deleting alerts created by other users requires Workspace Owner role"
> All users can delete alerts that they created, but only those with [Workspace Owner role](/docs/segment-app/iam/roles/) can delete alerts created by other users.
