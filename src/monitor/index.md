title: Monitor Overview
---
With Segment’s auditing and alerting capabilities, you can monitor the health of your integrations, diagnose issues that might be present in your data pipeline, and view a record of all user and system activity that happened in Segment over the past 90 days. 

Receive alerts for the performance and throughput of your Sources and Destinations, fluctuations in events delivered to your Reverse ETL mappings, and the performance and throughput of Audience syncs with Alerting. 

Segment’s Audit Trail provides a high-level view of all changes made in your workspace over the last 90 days. Use the Audit Trail and Audit Forwarding to quickly revert unintentional actions made in Segment to prevent downstream data loss.
