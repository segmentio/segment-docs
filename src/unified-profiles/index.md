[Unified Profiles in Flex](https://www.twilio.com/docs/flex/admin-guide/setup/unified-profiles){:target="_blank"} provides your Flex agents with real-time customer data from multiple enterprise systems. Agents can view each customer's details and a historical timeline that shows a customer's previous activities, enabling agents to provide personalized support based on a customer's history. Unified Profiles is currently in beta and access is limited. 

> info "Public Beta"
> Unified Profiles is currently available as a limited Public Beta product and the information contained in this document is subject to change.
