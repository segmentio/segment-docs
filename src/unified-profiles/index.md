[Unified Profiles in Flex](https://www.twilio.com/docs/flex/admin-guide/setup/unified-profiles){:target="_blank"} provides your Flex agents with real-time customer data from multiple enterprise systems. Agents can view each customer's details and a historical timeline that shows a customer's previous activities, enabling agents to provide personalized support based on a customer's history. Unified Profiles is currently in public beta.
