Journeys Level Analytics is a collection of statistics that can help you assess how a Journey is performing.

Follow these steps to view the Analytics for a specific Journey:

1. In your Segment workspace, navigate to **Engage > Journeys**.
2. Select a Journey from the Journeys list.
3. The Analytics tiles display as part of the Journey's overview.
