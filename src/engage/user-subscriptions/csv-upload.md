Use the CSV Uploader to add or update user subscription states.

When you upload a CSV file, Engage adds new profiles and updates existing user profiles. Each CSV row corresponds to a user profile and columns to an identifier in your [identity resolution configuration](/docs/unify/identity-resolution/identity-resolution-settings/).

You can also [set subscription states](#set-user-subscriptions) for each email and phone number that you upload in the CSV. Subscription states help you track which email addresses and numbers you have permission to market to.

> warning ""
> Uploading a CSV creates new profiles and updates existing profiles. These profile updates may lead to users entering existing audiences or message campaigns.

> info ""
> Using the CSV Uploader to upload user profiles to Engage will **not** increase your MTUs count. [Learn more](/docs/guides/usage-and-billing/mtus-and-throughput/#mtus-and-engage) about MTUs and Engage.

## Upload a CSV file

Follow these steps to add subscribers with a CSV file upload

1. Navigate to **Engage > Engage settings > Subscriptions**. 
2. Click **Add global subscribers**.
3. On the **Update subscription statuses** page, click **Upload a CSV**.

### 1. Download your CSV template

Click **Download Template** to download a CSV template with identifier columns from your identity resolution configuration. Engage adds subscription columns next to email and SMS identifiers, where you can update subscription states for email addresses and phone numbers.

> info ""
> CSV files can only have a single **email** and **phone** identifier column. Include any additional email addresses or phone numbers for a user profile as a separate row.

Navigate to **Unify > Unify settings** and select the **Identity resolution** tab to view or add identifiers in your Segment workspace.

### 2. Fill out your CSV file

Enter values for the identifiers in your CSV file. You can also [set email, phone, and WhatsApp subscriptions](#set-user-subscriptions) using the `email_subscription_status`, `sms_subscription_status`, and `whatsapp_subscription_status` columns.

A few best practices to keep in mind as you fill out your CSV:

- Leave any unknown values blank to avoid bad data. Engage can create a user profile from a single identifier in your CSV.
- Enter phone numbers in your CSV in a format that's consistent with your Segment space. For example, if existing profiles in your workspace are in E.164 format `+15555550123`, enter numbers in your CSV using the same format `+##########`.


### 3. Upload your CSV file

Upload a CSV file to Twilio Engage in two ways:
- Drag and drop the CSV file in the dropzone.
- Click **Browse** to locate the CSV file.

Engage processes CSV rows sequentially. Column values, except for a blank subscription status, override previous values for a user profile.

A blank subscription status in the CSV doesn't overwrite current **email** or **phone** [subscription states](/docs/engage/user-subscriptions/subscription-states/) in your Segment space.

### 4. Name your custom trait

Every time you upload a file, you have the option to add a custom trait to user profiles in the CSV. Use custom traits to help you [create audiences](/docs/engage/audiences/#building-an-audience) or send messages to a specific group of users. You can also add an existing custom trait name from your Segment workspace to the list of users in the CSV file.

[Custom traits](/docs/unify/traits/custom-traits/) display in the Custom Traits tab of a user profile in the Profile explorer. 

## View Update History

Use the Update History page to view CSV file uploads in your workspace over the last 30 days.

To view the Update History page:

1. Navigate to **Unify > Profile explorer** or **Engage > Engage settings > Subscriptions**.
2. From the **Subscriptions** section, click **View update history**.
3. From the **Upload history** table, click the file name link to download the [error reports](#error-reports).

View the status of the file upload and the custom trait name added to user profiles in the CSV upload. The error report only shows rows that Segment couldn't successfully process.  

### Error reports

Use error reports to fix invalid rows and quickly re-upload data.

From the Update History page:

1. Select the link in the **Report** column to download an error report CSV. All rows not present in the error report were processed successfully.
2. Correct data in the invalid rows.
3. Remove any extra columns such as `row_number`, `error_message`, and `error_code`.
3. Click **Update subscription statuses**, and select **Upload a CSV** to re-upload the file.

Engage uses the following error codes on the report:

| Error code                  | Description                                                                                                                                                  |

| INVALID_PHONE               | The phone number is invalid.                                                                                                                                 |
| INVALID_SUBSCRIPTION_STATUS | The subscription status is invalid. Check the status or leave it blank.                                                                                      |

| SYSTEM_ERROR                | Something went wrong. Please try again.                                                                                                                      |
| UNABLE_TO_SUBSCRIBE         | You can't update the subscription status for this phone number because the user unsubscribed by replying `STOP`. The user must reply `START` to resubscribe. |


### Validation errors

The following table lists validation errors you may run into with your CSV upload:

| Error                                | Error Message                                                                                      |

| Extraneous columns/column name typos | This file has columns that do not match the identifiers in your identity resolution configuration. |


## Set user subscriptions

Use the CSV Uploader to set subscription states for user email addresses and phone numbers.

> info ""
> Each user profile in a Segment workspace can have multiple email addresses and phone numbers, all with different subscription states.

For each CSV file, Engage adds:
- An `email_subscription_status` column next to the **Email** column.
- `whatsapp_subscription_status` and `sms_subscription_status` columns next to the **Phone** column.

In the `email_subscription_status`, `sms_subscription_status`, and `whatsapp_subscription_status` columns, set subscription states for email and phone numbers with the following values:

- `subscribed`: The user has actively subscribed.
- `unsubscribed`: The user has actively unsubscribed.
- `did-not-subscribe`: The user has provided their contact information but didn't actively subscribe or unsubscribe.
- **No subscription status (blank value)**: The user's profile exists in Segment, but they haven't explicitly provided their contact information, and no subscription information is available.

Engage accepts both uppercase and lowercase subscription status values.

> success ""
> Only contact users that subscribe to your communications. View [User Subscription States](/docs/engage/user-subscriptions/subscription-states/) to learn more.


## Message consent

Segment recommends sending to subscribed users. If a recipient deletes or flags an unwanted message as spam, inbox providers might start to filter your messages straight to spam folders.
