This guide helps you configure mappings for Engage events in Actions Destinations. 


## Overview

Engage Mappings let you transform and send user data to downstream destinations. When Engage events get sent to destinations, they may need to be formatted or adjusted to match the destinationâ€™s expected data structure. Without mapping, critical user information like audience membership or enriched traits may not sync correctly.

This guide explains how to configure mappings for Engage events in Actions Destinations, including:

- The differences between Identify and Track events.
- How to extract and map data from Engage event payloads.
- A step-by-step walkthrough of mapping configurations.
- Advanced features like Trait Enrichment to pass additional profile data.
