To add structure to your marketing content, you can organize templates into folders and duplicate them within your Segment space.

## Organize with folders

Use folders to organize your Email, SMS/MMS, Push, and WhatsApp content templates. Group related content together to better help you manage and find your marketing resources.
 
From the Templates overview page you can create, update, view, and delete template folders.

> You must have both read and write workspace permissions to create or make changes to folders.
 

To create a folder:

1. Navigate to **Engage > Content**.
2. Select the tab for the template type (Email, SMS, WhatsApp, or Push) you'd like to create the folder for. 
3. Click **Create**, then select **Folder**.
4. Add a folder name, then click **Create**. 
 
You can also rename, add templates, or disband your folder from the Templates overview page. Disbanding a folder returns all templates from the folder to the main template list, without deleting any of the templates.

> You can only organize templates in your folders according to template type. For example, you can't group email and SMS templates in the same folder.

### Move templates to your folders

From the Templates overview page, you can select individual template(s) to move to your folders. 

After you select the templates you'd like to move:
1. Click **Actions**, and select **Move Templates**.
2. Select the destination folder, then click **Move templates to folder**.

Use the **Actions** button in your folder to remove templates or move them to a different location. When you remove a template, Engage returns the template to the Templates overview page, without deleting it.
