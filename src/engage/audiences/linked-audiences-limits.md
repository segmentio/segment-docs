To provide consistent performance and reliability at scale, Segment enforces default use limits for Linked Audiences.

## Usage limits
The Linked Audiences module provides you the flexibility to create and publish unlimited Linked Audiences within each billing cycle. This means you won't encounter any limitations or pauses in service related to the number of Linked Audiences you generate.

Linked Audience limits are measured based on Activation Events, which is the number of times profiles are processed to each destination, including audience entered, audience exited, and entity change events. This includes both successful and failed attempts. For example, if you processed an audience of 50k to Braze and Google Ads Conversions, then your total Activation Event usage is 100k records.

Your plan includes a high limit of Activation Events, which ensures that the vast majority of users can use Linked Audiences freely without needing to worry about the limit. 

 To see how many Activation Events you’ve processed using Linked Audiences, navigate to **Settings > Usage & billing** and select the **Linked Audiences** tab. If your limit is reached before the end of your billing period, your syncs won't automatically pause to avoid disruptions to your business. You may be billed for overages in cases of significant excess usage. If you consistently require a higher limit, contact your sales representative to upgrade your plan with a custom limit.

If you have a non-standard or high volume usage plan, you may have unique Linked Audiences limits or custom pricing.
