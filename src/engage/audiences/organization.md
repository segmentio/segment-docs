To add structure to your [Spaces](/docs/unify/identity-resolution/space-setup/), you can organize Audiences into folders and clone Audiences within, and between, Spaces.

## Working with folders

Folders allow you to group Audiences together. You can create, edit, and search through folders directly within the Engage Audiences page.

### Creating a folder

To create a Folder, follow the steps below:

1. Navigate to the Audiences tab within your Space.
2. Click **Create**, then select **Folder** from the dropdown menu.
3. Give your Folder a unique name, then click **Add Audiences**.
4. Search for and select the Audience(s) you want to add to the Folder.
5. To confirm the new Folder, click **Add Audiences**.

## Editing and disbanding folders

To edit the name or description of a Folder you've created, click the **More Options** icon and select **Edit**. Once you've made your desired changes, click **Save**.

To disband a Folder you've made, click the **More Options** icon and select **Disband**. Audiences from the disbanded Folder return to your main Audience list.

> Disbanding folders does not delete audiences.

## Moving Audiences into folders

To move an Audience to a Folder you've already created, follow the steps below:

1. Navigate to the **Audiences** tab within your Space.
2. Hover over the Audience you want to move.
3. Check the selection box that appears next to the Audience name.
4. *(Optional)*: Repeat Steps 2 and 3 to move multiple Audiences.
5. Click the **Move** icon that appears in the Audiences header.
6. Select your destination Folder from the modal window.
7. Click **Move** to confirm and move the selected Audiences.


## Clone Audiences

Audience cloning creates a copy of your Audience. You can clone an Audience within the same space, or clone an Audience to a different space.

### Clone an Audience inside a Space

To clone an Audience within the same Space, follow the steps below:

1. Navigate to the **Audiences** tab within your Space.
2. Click the **More Options** icon next to the Audience you want to clone.
3. From the dropdown menu, click **Clone**.
4. Select **Current Space**, then click **Continue**.
5. Configure the Audience, click **Preview Results**, then click **Select Destination**.
6. *(Optional)*: On the next screen, connect the Audience to a Destination.  Click **Review & Create**.
7. Give your Audience a unique name, then click **Create Audience**.

### Cloning an Audience between Spaces

You may wish to clone an Audience between spaces for a number of use cases, including the following:


* Copying an Audience between testing and production spaces
* Copying an Audience between business units
* Copying an Audience between teams

> info "Note"
> When you clone an Audience to a different space, first verify that the target Space includes the same events and traits for the cloned Audience.

To clone an Audience between Spaces, follow the steps below:

1. Navigate to the **Audiences** tab within your Space.
2. Click the **More Options** icon next to the Audience you want to clone.
3. From the dropdown menu, click **Clone**.
4. Select **Different Space**, choose your target Space, then click **Continue**.
5. Configure the Audience, click **Preview Results**, then click **Select Destination**.
6. *(Optional)*: On the next screen, connect the Audience to a Destination.  Click **Review & Create**.
7. Give your Audience a unique name, then click **Create Cloned Audience**.


If your target Space doesn't include the cloned Audience's events and traits, Engage prompts you to resolve the Space incompatibilities during Step 5.  As a best practice, verify that the target Space includes the Audience's traits and events before cloning.


## Delete an Audience

To delete an Audience, follow the steps below:

1. Navigate to the **Audiences** tab within your Space.
2. Select the Audience you want to delete, then click **Settings**.
3. Click **Enabled** to toggle to **Disabled**, then click **Delete Audience...**.
4. On the Delete Audience prompt, click **Delete Audience** to confirm.

When an audience is deleted, the audiece will then become a custom trait on the user's profile.
