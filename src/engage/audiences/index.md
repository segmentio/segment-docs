Audiences let you group users or accounts based on event behavior and traits that Segment tracks.

You can build Audiences from core **tracking events**, **traits**, and **computed traits**. You can then sync Audiences to hundreds of [Destinations](/docs/connections/destinations/) or access them with the [Profile API](/docs/profiles/profile-api).

## Building an Audience

You can build an Audience from existing events, traits, computed traits, or other Audiences.

![Creating an Engage Audience from the conditions list](/docs/engage/images/audience_condition_list.png)

### Events

You can build an Audience from any events that are connected to Engage, including [Track](/docs/connections/spec/track), [Page](/docs/connections/spec/page), and [Screen](/docs/connections/spec/screen) calls. You can use the `property` button to refine the audience on specific event properties, as well. Select `and not who` to indicate users that have not performed an event. For example, you might want to look at all users that have viewed a product above a certain price point but not completed the order.

![Creating an Audience of users who viewed a product without buying it](/docs/engage/images/audience_builder.png)

You can also specify two different types of time-windows, `within` and `in between`. The `within` property lets you specify an event that occurred in the last `x` number of days, while `in between` lets you specify events that occurred over a rolling time window in the past. A common use case is to look at all customers that were active 30 to 90 days ago, but have not completed an action in the last 30 days.

### Custom Traits

You can also build Audiences based on custom traits. These traits can be collected from your apps when a user completes a form or signs up using an [Identify](/docs/connections/spec/identify) call. You can view these traits in the user explorer, as well.

### Computed Traits

You can also use computed traits in an Audience definition. For example, you can create a `total_revenue` computed trait and use it to generate an audience of `big_spender` customers that exceed a certain threshold.


### Funnel Audiences

Funnel audiences allow you to specify strict ordering between two events. This might be the case if you want an event to happen or not happen within a specific time window, as in the following example:

![An Audience funnel of users who, in the last week, began checkout without completing it](/docs/engage/images/funnel_audiences1.png)

### Dynamic property references

Dynamic Property references give you more flexibility over funnel audiences. Instead of specifying a constant value in both events, like `product_id = 123` for both Product Viewed and Order Completed events, you can specify that a child event references an event property of a parent event. You can also compare an event property to a trait variable.

![Using dynamic property references with an Audience funnel](/docs/engage/images/dynamic_property_audiences1.png)

### Account-level audiences

If you have a B2B business, you might want to build an Audience of accounts. You can use both account-level traits that you've sent through the [Group](/docs/connections/spec/group) call, or user-level traits and events. For example, you might want to re-engage a list of at-risk accounts defined as companies which are on a business tier plan and where none of the users in that account have logged in recently. When incorporating user-level events or traits, you can specify `None of the users`, `Any users`, or `All users`.

See [Account-level Audiences](/docs/engage/audiences/account-audiences) for more information.



## Send Audiences to Destinations
With the help of Sources and Destinations in Segment's catalog, you can create and send Audiences and computed traits to third-party services.

Segment's Connections pipeline first collects and sends events from your Source to your Destination. Built on top of Connections, Engage then uses the same Source events to let you create Audiences and computed traits within Segment. You can then send the Audience or computed trait you've built to your Destination(s).

> info ""
> Because Engage only sends Audiences and computed traits to Destinations, it doesn't replace a standard event pipeline. Connect a Source directly to a Destination if you want the Destination to receive all events that Segment gathers.

### Connect your Audience to a Destination

> warning "Audience Keys"
> Avoid using the same Audience key twice, even if you've deleted the original Audience.

Once you've previewed your Audience, you can choose to connect it to a Destination or keep the Audience in Segment and export it as a CSV file download.

If you already have Destinations set up in Segment, you can import the configuration from one of your existing sources to Engage. You can only connect one Destination configuration per Destination type.

When you create an Audience, Segment starts syncing your Audience to the Destinations you selected. Audiences are either sent to Destinations as a boolean user-property or a user-list, depending on what the Destination supports. Read more about [supported Destinations](/docs/engage/using-engage-data/#compatible-engage-destinations) in the Engage documentation.

For account-level audiences, you can send either a [Group](/docs/connections/spec/group) call and/or [Identify](/docs/connections/spec/identify) call. Group calls will send one event per account, whereas Identify calls will send an Identify call for each user in the account. This means that even if a user hasn't performed an event, Segment will still set the account-level computed trait on that user.

Because most marketing tools are still based at the user level, it is often important to map this account-level trait onto each user within an account. See [Account-level Audiences](/docs/engage/audiences/account-audiences) for more information.

> info ""
> When you connect a new Destination to an existing Audience, Engage will backfill historical data for that Audience to the new Destination.

## Understanding compute times

Because a number of factors (like system load, backfills, or user bases) determine the complexity of an Audience, some compute times take longer than others.

As a result, **Segment recommends waiting at least 24 hours for an Audience to finish computing** before you resume working with the Audience.

From the Overview page, you can view Audience details including the current compute status and a progress bar for real-time and batch Audiences. Engage updates the progress bar and status for real-time computations approximately every 10 minutes.

> info ""
> Engage only displays the progress bar and status updates when you create a new Audience or Trait.

> warning ""
> Engage syncs the Overview page for an individual audience more frequently than the Engage Audiences page (**Engage > Audiences**). As a result, you might see temporary discrepancies in Audience details, such as user counts, between these two pages.

### Refresh real-time Audiences and Traits

For real-time computations, you can click **Refresh Audience** or **Refresh Trait** to update user counts, status, and compute progress.

### Compute statuses

Engage displays the following compute statuses for Audiences and Traits.

#### Real-time computations

| Computation status        | Description                           |
|---------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Preparing                 | Engage is preparing the computation.  |
| Computing                 | Engage is computing the Audience or Trait.           |
| Live                      | The Audience or Trait is live. Users will enter in real-time as they meet entry criteria.        |
| Disabled                  | The Audience or Trait is disabled.                   |
| Failed                    | The computation was cancelled or failed to compute. Please contact [Segment support](https://segment.com/help/contact/){:target="_blank"}.            |


#### Batch computations

| Computation status        | Description                           |
|---------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Preparing                 | Engage is preparing the computation.  |
| Computing                 | Engage is computing the Audience or Trait.  |
| Live                      | The Audience or Trait is up-to-date, based on the most recent sync cadence. When you edit a batch Audience or Trait, Engage displays the compute status as `Live` and incorporates your edits in the next scheduled sync.                 |
| Not Computing             | Engage displays this status when there are no destinations connected or `Compute without connected destinations` isn't selected.         |
| Disabled                  | The Audience or Trait is disabled.    |
| Failed                    | The computation was cancelled or failed to compute. Please contact [Segment support](https://segment.com/help/contact/){:target="_blank"}.    |


## Real-time compute compared to batch

Real-time Compute allows you to update traits and Audiences as Segment receives new events. Real-time Compute unlocks exciting use cases:

- **Intra-Session App Personalization:** change your app experience with personalized onboarding, product recommendations, and faster funnels based on a user entering and exiting an audience.
- **Instant Messaging:** Trigger messages in email, live chat, and push notifications instantly, to deliver immediate experiences across channels.
- **Operational Workflows:** Supercharge your sales and support teams by responding to customer needs faster, based on the latest understanding of a user.

To create a new Audience or Trait:

1. Go to your **Computed Traits** or **Audiences** tab in Engage and select **Create**.

2. Configure and preview your Audience or Trait.
- A lightning bolt next to `Realtime Enabled` indicates that the computation updates in real-time.
- By default, Segment queries all historical data to set the current value of the computed trait and Audience. Backfill computes historical data up to the point of audience creation. You can uncheck **Include Historical Data** to compute values for the Audience or trait without historical data. With backfill disabled, the trait or Audience only uses the data that arrives after you create it.

3. Select destinations to connect, then review and create your Audience or Trait.

While Engage is computing, use the Audience Explorer to see users or accounts that enter your Audience. Engage displays the Audience as computing in the Explorer until at least one user or account enters.

> warning ""
> [Facebook Custom Audiences](/docs/connections/destinations/catalog/personas-facebook-custom-audiences/), [Marketo Lists](/docs/connections/destinations/catalog/marketo-static-lists/), and [Adwords Remarking Lists](/docs/connections/destinations/catalog/adwords-remarketing-lists) impose rate limits on how quickly Segment can update an Audience. Segment syncs at the highest frequency allowed by the tool, which is between one and six hours.

### Editing Realtime Audiences and Traits

Engage supports the editing of realtime Audiences and Traits, which allows you to make nuanced changes to existing Traits and Audiences in situations where cloning or building from scratch may not suit your use case.

To edit a realtime Trait or Audience, follow these steps:

1. In your Engage Space, select the **Computed Traits** or **Audiences** tab.
2. Select the realtime Audience or Trait you want to edit.
3. Select the **Builder** tab and make your edits.
4. Preview the results, then select **Create Audience** to confirm your edits.

Engage then processes your realtime Audience or Trait edits. While the edit task runs, the audience remains locked and you can't make further changes. Once Engage incorporates your changes, you'll be able to access your updated Audience or Trait. 

> warning ""
> If your audience includes historical data (Historical Backfill is enabled), editing an audience creates a new backfill task. The backfill task, and therefore the edit task, take longer to process if the audience is connected to a destination with rate limits. Rate-limited destinations dictate how fast Engage can backfill. View a list of [rate-limited destinations](/docs/engage/using-engage-data/#rate-limits-on-engage-event-destinations).

> warning ""
> It is not possible to edit an audience to convert it from real-time to batch, or vice-versa. If the computation type needs to be changed, you will need to recreate the audience with the appropriate conditions.


## Access your Audiences using the Profiles API

You can access your Audiences using the Profile API by querying the `/traits` endpoint. For example, you can query for `high_value_user` property with the following `GET` request:

```
https://profiles.segment.com/v1/spaces/<workspace_id>/collections/users/profiles/email:alex@segment.com/traits?limit=100&include=high_value_user
```

The query would return the following payload:

```json
    {
        "traits": {
            "high_value_user": true
        },
        "cursor": {
            "url": "",
            "has_more": false,
            "next": "",
            "limit": 100
        }
    }
```
You can read the [full Profile API docs](/docs/profiles/profile-api/) to learn more.

## Download your Audience as a CSV file

You can download a copy of your Audience by visiting the the Audience overview page.
![Downloading an Audience as a CSV file](/docs/engage/images/audience_overview.png)
Before you can download the CSV, you will need to generate it. There are three different options for formatting:

- **Unformatted:** Contains two columns. The first contains the user or account key and the second is a JSON object containing the external IDs. Generating this CSV is faster than the formatted option below. [Download example unformatted CSV](/docs/engage/files/audience_csv_format_a.csv)
- **Formatted (with indexed columns for ID types with multiple values):** Contains the same first two columns as the unformatted CSV. Additional columns are added for each distinct external ID type. When a given external ID type has more than one value, for example a user with three email addresses, _additional columns with indexed headers are added_, (`email`, `email_1`, `email_2`). [Download example formatted CSV with indexed columns](/docs/engage/files/audience_csv_format_b.csv)
- **Single Column (with one external ID type):** Contains only a single column of data with the selected external ID type. When the given external ID type has more than one value, for example a user with two email addresses, _additional rows are added._ Data in this format is hashed by default with the SHA256 hashing algorithm, but may be downloaded raw (unhashed) with appropriate permissions. This format is useful for uploading the audience to destinations like Snapchat or Braze, which may require a single column of hashed emails, for example. [Download example single column hashed CSV](/docs/engage/files/audience_csv_format_c.csv)


<table>
  <tr>
    <td>![](/docs/engage/images/large_audience_csv.png)</td>
    <td width="45%">Generating a CSV can take a substantial amount of time for large audiences (around 30 seconds for a formatted CSV with 1 million rows). For CSVs that are expected to take over 20 seconds, Segment displays an estimated generation time. After you generate the CSV file, leave the modal window open while Segment creates the file.
    (If the audience recalculates between when you click Generate and when you download the file, you might want to regenerate the file. The CSV is a snapshot from when you clicked Generate, and could be outdated.)</td>
