This guide walks you through the set up process for a simple Engage space, which you can use if your Segment implementation is simple. If your implementation is complex, you can use this to demonstrate and test Engage before working on a more complex configuration.

## Engage configuration requirements
> info ""
> Engage requires both [Connections](/docs/connections/) and [Unify](/docs/unify/).

To configure and use Engage, you need the following:

1. **A Segment account and Workspace.**
2. **Events flowing into Connections** from your digital properties where most of your valuable user behavior occurs.
3. **Profiles identity admin access.** You must have edit access to identity resolution rules.
4. **Engage Administrator access.** You must be either be a workspace admin, or a workspace user with Engage admin access to set up audiences and computed traits. You can check your permissions by navigating to [Access Management](https://app.segment.com/goto-my-workspace/settings/access-management){:target="_blank"} in your workspace settings. See the [Segment Access Management documentation](/docs/segment-app/iam/) for more details.

## Step 1: Create a new Developer space

When you first start working with Engage, you should start by creating a "Developer" Engage space. This is your experimental and test environment while you learn more about how Engage works.

<!-- TODO: I can't see this in any of the spaces I'm an admin in
To create a Engage space:
1. In your Segment workspace, click **Engage** from the left-navigation.
2.  -->

## Step 2: Invite teammates to your Engage space

Invite teammates to your Engage dev space and grant them access to the space. Navigate to [Access Management](https://app.segment.com/goto-my-workspace/settings/access-management){:target="_blank"} in your workspace settings to add them.

<!-- TODO: actually add steps here -->

## Step 3: Connect production sources

1. From your Engage space, go to your space Settings and click **Sources**.
2. On the screen that appears, choose one or two production sources from your Connections workspace.
   Segment recommends connecting your production website or App source as a great starting point.

To learn more, visit [Connect production sources](/docs/unify/quickstart/#step-3-connect-production-sources).

## Step 4: Check your profile data

Once the replay finishes, you can see the data replayed into Engage using the Profile Explorer. Visit the [Unify Onboarding Guide](/docs/unify/quickstart/#step-4-check-your-profile-data) for more info.

## Step 5: Create an Audience

You can build an audience using any of the source data that flows into your Engage space. To further verify your data, in this step create an Audience that you are familiar with, and that you already have a rough idea of the size of. For example, you might know the number of new website user sign-ups in the last seven days, if you've connected your production website source to Engage.

The Audience Builder UI prompts you to filter your users using on specific behaviors that they performed. The audience in the example below is all the users who have performed the event `User Signed Up` at least one time within the last 7 days:

![Example audience with users who have performed the User Signed Up event](images/pers-qs-config_audience.png)

To build your own audience:
1. Navigate to your Engage space.
2. Select the **Audiences** tab, then click **Create**.
3. Click **Add Condition**, and choose among the options that appear:
   - Performed an Event
   - Part of an Audience
   - Have a Computed Trait
   - Have a SQL Trait
   - Have a Custom Trait
4. Configure the settings for your condition. These vary by type, so explore the different options.
5. Optionally, add more conditions until you're satisfied that the audience will only contain the users you want to target.

Once you build your audience, click **Preview Results** to see the total number of users who meet the audience criteria, for example all users who signed up within the last seven days.


## Step 6:  Connect the Audience to a Destination

Once you create your test audience, click **Select Destinations**. Engage guides you through configuration steps to set up a destination for your audience. If you don't already have destinations configured for the Engage space, the you are prompted to select one or more. Finally, enter a name for the audience.

The larger the audience you're creating, the longer it takes Engage to successfully compute the Audience. The Audience page shows a status that indicates if the audience is still being calculated. When the total number of users appears in the Audience overview, as in the example screenshot below, the audience has successfully finished computing, and Engage then sends the audience to the destination you selected.

## Step 7: Validate that your audience is appearing in your destination

Audiences are either sent to destinations as a boolean user-property (for example `New_Users_7days=true` or a user-list, depending on what the destination supports. Read more about [which destinations support which types of data](/docs/engage/using-engage-data/#engage-compatible-destinations-event-type).

The UIs for the destination tools you send the audience data to are different, so the process of validating the audience varies per tool. However, the guiding principle is the same. You should be able to identify the full group of users who are members of your audience in your destination.

## Step 8: Create your production space

Once you validate that your full audience is arriving in your destination, you're ready to create a Production space. Segment recommends that you repeat the same steps outlined above, focusing on your production use cases and data sources.
