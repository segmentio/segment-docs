Twilio Engage brings Segment, Twilio, and SendGrid together to help you create and send email and SMS campaigns to your customers.

Before sending your first Engage campaign, though, you’ll need to configure and connect accounts with all three platforms.

This guide lists all required onboarding steps and walks you through Engage setup.  By the end of the onboarding process, you’ll be ready to send your first campaign.

## Before you begin: overview and task checklist

You’ll set up Twilio Engage in three stages:

<<<<<<< HEAD
1. Configure Personas Identifiers in your Segment workspace.
2. Create and configure a SendGrid account.
3. Create and configure Twilio SMS services.

Several onboarding steps require copying and pasting information between Segment and SendGrid or Twilio. To streamline setup, open your Personas workspace in one browser tab and open two others for tasks you’ll carry out in SendGrid and Twilio.

Continue reading for a detailed, step-by-step breakdown of each onboarding stage.

## Stage 1: Configure Personas Identifiers in segment

Through [identity resolution](/docs/personas/identity-resolution/), Segment uses the `email` and `phone` traits to identify users who can receive your Engage campaigns. To begin using Engage, you’ll need to verify that these identifiers exist in your workspace and add them if they don’t.

Follow these steps to configure the traits:

1. In your Segment workspace, navigate to **Personas > Settings > Identity Resolution**.
2. Under the Identity Resolution Configuration table, verify that `email` and `phone` appear under the **Identifier** column. If so, your Personas space is configured correctly; skip to [create and configure a SendGrid account](#stage-2-create-and-configure-a-sendgrid-account).
3. If either identifier is missing, click the **Add Identifier** button.
4. In the **New Custom Identifier** modal, add the first missing trait (`email` or `phone`) in the **Trait/Property key** field, then click **Add Identifier**.
5. If both traits were missing, repeat Step 4 and add the other missing trait (`email` or `phone`). Finish by clicking **Add Identifier**.

Your Segment workspace is now configured for Engage.  Next, you’ll create a SendGrid account and connect it to Segment.

## Stage 2: Create and configure a SendGrid account

SendGrid powers delivery of your Engage email campaigns. During this stage of onboarding, you’ll create and set up a SendGrid Pro account. You’ll then configure SendGrid and Personas to enable both subscription tracking and an event webhook.

### Create your SendGrid Pro account

Start by creating a SendGrid account and then upgrading to the SendGrid Pro Plan:

1. Visit the [SendGrid website](https://sendgrid.com/){:target="_blank"} and sign up for an account.
2. Within your SendGrid space, navigate to **Settings > Account Details > Your Products**.
3. Under the **Email API** section, select **Change Plan**.
4. On the Email API Plans page, select a Pro option that fits your anticipated sending needs.
5. Add the Pro option to your cart, and complete checkout.

> info "Upgrading to SendGrid Pro"
> Upgrading to a SendGrid Pro account may require additional action on your part. Follow the instructions in [SendGrid's account upgrade guide](https://support.sendgrid.com/hc/en-us/articles/1260802642689-Unable-to-Upgrade-a-SendGrid-Account){:target="_blank"} to complete your upgrade.

### Create a subuser and check the dedicated IP address

<<<<<<< HEAD
Next, you’ll create a SendGrid subuser and ensure the dedicated IP has been assigned. Your SendGrid subuser username must begin with the prefix `twilio_engage_app_`. Add a unique identifier to the end of the prefix, for example, `twilio_engage_app_someusername`. Make a note of the combined username you’ve created; you’ll use it when you add your SendGrid information to Engage.

1. In your SendGrid space, navigate to **Settings > Subuser Management**, then click **Create New Subuser**.
2. In the **Create New Subuser** window, enter the username you created above, then add an email address and password.
3. In the same window, click the checkbox next to the IP address from Step 1.
=======
Next, you’ll create a SendGrid subuser and ensure that a dedicated IP has been assigned:

1. In your SendGrid space, navigate to **Settings > Subuser Management**, then click **Create New Subuser**.
2. In the **Create New Subuser** window, create a username for the subuser, then add an email address and password. Your SendGrid subuser username must begin with the prefix `twilio_engage_app_`. Add a unique identifier to the end of the prefix, for example, `twilio_engage_app_someusername`.

    ![Adding a SendGrid subuser](images/subuser.png "Adding a SendGrid subuser")

3. In the same window, click the checkbox next to the dedicated IP address for the subuser.

4. Fill out the remaining fields in the window, then click **Create Subuser**.
5. Using [SendGrid’s documentation](https://docs.sendgrid.com/ui/account-and-settings/dedicated-ip-addresses){:target="_blank"}, warm up the IP address.

### Authenticate your domain

<<<<<<< HEAD
All further SendGrid onboarding steps require you to be signed in as the new subuser. If you're not logged in as the new subusers, log out of SendGrid, then log back in using the Engage credentials you created above.
=======
> info "Log in as the subuser"
> All further SendGrid onboarding steps require you to be signed in as the new subuser you just created. If you're not logged in as the new subuser, log out of SendGrid, then log back in using the subuser credentials you created above.
>>>>>>> master

Now, you’ll authenticate your domain with SendGrid and your DNS provider and [enable link branding](https://docs.sendgrid.com/ui/account-and-settings/how-to-set-up-link-branding){:target="_blank"}. Domain authentication protects your sending reputation by showing email providers that you’ve given SendGrid permission to send email campaigns for you.

To authenticate your domain, you’ll copy CNAME records given to you by SendGrid and paste them into your DNS provider. **Before you begin, verify that you have the necessary permissions to add CNAME records to your DNS.** If you’re not sure if you have the right permissions, reach out to your organization’s IT department.

You’ll authenticate your domain using the SendGrid platform and your DNS provider:

1. Follow [SendGrid’s domain authentication guide](https://docs.sendgrid.com/ui/account-and-settings/how-to-set-up-domain-authentication){:target="_blank"}.
2. During the authentication process, SendGrid asks if you would like to brand links for your domain. Select **Yes**.
3. SendGrid provides you with five CNAME records.  Add them to your DNS host.
4. Return to SendGrid and [verify your DNS](https://docs.sendgrid.com/ui/account-and-settings/how-to-set-up-domain-authentication#verifying-your-dns){:target="_blank"}.

Complete authentication by setting up reverse DNS:

1. Follow [SendGrid’s reverse DNS (rDNS) documentation](https://docs.sendgrid.com/ui/account-and-settings/how-to-set-up-reverse-dns){:target="_blank"}.
<<<<<<< HEAD
2. SendGrid provides you with five CNAME records and one A record.  Add them to your DNS host.
=======
2. SendGrid provides you with one A record. Add it to your DNS host, along with the five CNAME records from the previous steps.
>>>>>>> master
3. Return to SendGrid and [verify your DNS](https://docs.sendgrid.com/ui/account-and-settings/how-to-set-up-reverse-dns#verifying){:target="_blank"}.

### Enable subscription tracking

You'll also need to enable [subscription tracking](https://docs.sendgrid.com/ui/sending-email/subscription-tracking){:target="_blank"}, which keeps records of users who unsubscribe from your email campaigns:

1. Within your SendGrid space, navigate to **Settings > Tracking**.
2. Under the Settings column, click **Subscription Tracking**.
3. At the end of the Subscription Tracking window, toggle **Setting State** to `enabled`.
4. Click **Save**.
