Twilio Engage provides you with analytics that give you insight into the performance of your [email, SMS, and WhatsApp campaigns](/docs/engage/campaigns/).

On this page, you'll learn how Engage calculates campaign analytics and which messaging metrics you can view.

## Access a campaign's analytics

You'll find a campaign's analytics within its parent Journey, using the following instructions:

1. Within your Space, select the **Journeys** tab.
2. From the Journeys table, select the Journey you want to view.
3. From the Journey overview, select the email, SMS, or WhatsApp campaign you want to view.
4. A side panel appears that displays your campaign's analytics.

## How Engage measures campaign analytics

Understanding when and how Engage measures campaign analytics will help you as you review your analytics reports.

Engage begins tracking campaign performance after you send a campaign. As a result, a campaign's analytics only reflect conversions that occurred after campaign publication. For example, suppose you send an email campaign promoting a sale in your online store. If a customer purchases a qualifying product **before** receiving your campaign, their purchase would not count as a conversion.

### Changing a campaign's base metrics 

Clicking on a campaign in a Journey opens a side panel that shows your campaign’s analytics. You can change both the date range and the base percentage type for any campaign.

The date range picker initially inherits the date range set in the campaign’s parent Journey, but you can use the campaign date range picker to define a range for the specific campaign you’re viewing. Changing a campaign’s date range won’t impact the parent Journey’s date range.

By default, Engage bases a campaign’s metrics on the number of sent messages. The **Calculate metrics using** dropdown lets you change this denominator value so that Engage bases analytics on the number of delivered messages. Changing the denominator won't impact the **Converted** metric, though, since conversions are already based on delivered messages.

SendGrid powers Engage's email campaign event analytics. For more details on email metrics, view SendGrid's [Marketing Campaigns Statistics Overview](https://docs.sendgrid.com/ui/analytics-and-reporting/marketing-campaigns-stats-overview){:target="_blank"}.

### Understanding machine opens

Machine opens occur when an email client automatically opens an email, giving the impression that a user opened your email even if they haven’t.

Segment tracks machine opens and subtracts them from the total number of opened emails. Segment displays this number in the **True Opened** tile, which gives a more reliable count of how many real users opened your campaign.

Hover over the **True Opened** tile for any campaign to see a full comparison of machine opens and true opens.
