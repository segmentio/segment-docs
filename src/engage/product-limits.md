To provide consistent performance and reliability at scale, Segment enforces default use and rate limits within Engage. Most customers do not exceed these limits.

To learn more about custom limits and upgrades, contact your dedicated Customer Success Manager or [friends@segment.com](mailto:friends@segment.com).


## Default Limits

| Name                                        | limit                                                       | Details                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| ------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Inbound Data Throughput                     | 1000 events per second                                      | Total event stream from sources connected to Engage, including historical data replays. Segment may slow request processing once this limit is reached.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Outbound Downstream Destination Rate Limits | Reduced retries when failures exceed 1000 events per second | Outbound Destination requests may fail for reasons outside of Segment's control.  For example, most Destinations enforce their own rate limits. As a result, Segment may deliver data faster than the Destination can accept. <br><br>  When Destination requests fail, Segment tries to deliver the data again. However, if more than 1000 requests per second fail or if the failure rate exceeds 50% for over 72 hours, Segment may reduce additional delivery attempts until the failure condition resolves. |


## Audiences and Computed Traits

| --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Compute Concurrency                           | 5 concurrent audiences or computed traits               | Segment computes five new audiences or computed traits at a time. Once the limit is reached, Segment queues additional computations until one of the five finishes computing.                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Edit Concurrency                           | 2 concurrent audiences or computed traits               | You can edit two concurrent audiences or computed traits at a time. Once the limit is reached, Segment queues and locks additional computations until one of the two finishes computing.                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Compute Throughput                            | 10000 computations per second         | Computations include any Track or Identify call that triggers an audience or computed trait re-computation. Once the limit is reached, Segment may slow audience processing.                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

| Audience Frequency Update                     | 1 per 8 hours                         | Audiences that require time windows, [funnels](/docs/engage/audiences/#funnel-audiences), [dynamic properties](/docs/engage/audiences/#dynamic-property-references), or [account-level membership](/docs/engage/audiences/#account-level-audiences) are processed on chronological schedules. Unless otherwise agreed upon, the audiences will compute at the limit set forth. |
| Event Properties (Computed Traits)            | 10,000                                | For Computed Traits that exceed this limit, Segment will not persist any new Event Properties and will drop new trait keys and corresponding values.                                                  |
