Segment associates a [user subscription state](/docs/engage/profiles/user-subscriptions/subscription-states/) with each contact vector in your Engage audiences. Subscription states give you insight into the level of consent a user has given you to receive your Engage campaigns.

You can set a user’s subscription state using a CSV file or, programmatically, using Segment’s APIs. On this page, you’ll learn how and when to use both processes.

## Setting user subscriptions with a CSV file upload

Setting user subscriptions by uploading a CSV file proves useful when you’re importing batch contacts to Segment for the first time or when you need to change a specific user’s subscription status.

For example, you may want to add contacts to Segment using an audience list sourced from a third-party tool, or you may have gathered a large number of contacts from an in-person event.

### Subscription state CSV fields

To learn how to upload a CSV file to Segment, view the [Engage CSV Uploader page](/docs/engage/profiles/csv-upload/).

To change a user’s email or SMS subscription status with a CSV file, include at least one of the following user subscription columns next to the contact column:

- `email_subscription_status`
- `sms_subscription_status`

These columns take the following values:

- `subscribed`; for users who opted in to your marketing campaigns
- `unsubscribed`; for users who have unsubscribed from your marketing campaigns
- `did_not_subscribe`; for users who have neither subscribed nor unsubscribed from your marketing campaigns
- Blank; for profiles that have no subscription information

Refer to the [User Subscription States documentation](/docs/engage/profiles/user-subscriptions/subscription-states/) for detailed explanations of each subscription state.

### Overriding a subscription state with a CSV upload

Because contact information from a CSV upload takes precedence over any existing contact vector details, you can use a CSV file upload to make manual changes to a user’s subscription status.

When you upload a CSV file, Segment creates new profiles for users not already in your audience. If the user already exists within an audience, Segment updates the contact’s profile to match the contact vector information provided within the CSV.

For example, a user might reach out to you after accidentally unsubscribing to your campaigns. If the user asks you to resubscribe them, you can upload a CSV file with the user’s contact vector next to a value of `subscribed` in the `email_subscription_status` field.  The subscription status then updates to subscribed.

> info "Resubscribing a user"
> As a best practice, encourage users to resubscribe themselves. Refer to [Troubleshooting Subscription States](/docs/engage/profiles/user-subscriptions/subscription-states/#troubleshooting-subscription-states) for case-by-case solutions to resolving subscription state issues.

## Managing user subscriptions with Segment APIs

Use Segment’s APIs to manage user subscriptions programmatically on an ongoing, real-time basis. You can choose between a [standard `track` call](/docs/connections/spec/track/), for non-critical subscription updates, or the [Public API](https://api.segmentapis.com/docs/){:target="_blank"}, for critical updates that require immediate confirmation, like unsubscribes.

Managing subscriptions with Segment's APIs allows you to handle continuous updates of subscription statuses, like when users subscribe to your marketing campaigns on a website form or modify their subscription from within a notification center.

### Receive subscription confirmation with the Public API

To receive an API response that confirms Segment has both received and processed subscription status requests, use Segment's [Public API](https://api.segmentapis.com/docs/spaces/#replace-messaging-subscriptions-in-spaces){:target="_blank"}.

For example, if a user updates their subscription state in your notification center:

1. Use the [Public API](https://api.segmentapis.com/docs/spaces/#replace-messaging-subscriptions-in-spaces){:target="_blank"} synchronous call to update their subscription state.
2. The API returns an immediate success or failure response.
3. For successful requests, Segment instantly updates subscription states in your workspace. `Subscribed` email and phone numbers will receive messages from Engage campaigns that they are a part of.
4. You can then display successful updates or error messages with users in your notification center.

## The `track` call versus using the Public API

When you use the `track` call, Segment replies with a standard HTTP `200 OK` status response code if it successfully received the request. Because the `track` call updates user traits asynchronously, though, the `200 OK` code indicates that Segment has received, but not yet processed, the request. As a result, use the `track` call for non-critical subscription updates, like form signups on your website or adding a subscription from within the user's notification center.

When you make calls to Segment's Public API, however, you'll get an immediate response that confirms that Segment both received and processed the request. Use the Public API, then, for user unsubscribes. If a user unsubscribes from your marketing campaigns within their notification center, they'll know immediately whether or not their request was processed.
