Segment associates [subscription states](/docs/engage/profiles/user-subscriptions/set-user-subscriptions/) with contact vectors in your audiences. These states indicate the level of consent end users have given to receive your marketing campaigns.

Knowledge of subscription states will help you understand which users can and cannot receive your campaigns. This page provides an overview of user subscriptions.

## The Four Subscription states

Contact vectors in your audience have one of the four following user subscription states:

- **Subscribed**; users who opted in to your marketing campaigns
- **Unsubscribed**; users who unsubscribed from your marketing campaigns
- **Did not subscribe**; users who are neither subscribed nor unsubscribed
- **No subscription status**; users for whom Segment has no subscription information

> warning "User Consent"
> You can only send Engage campaigns to subscribed users.

To learn how Segment determines user subscription states, read the [User Subscription State documentation](/docs/engage/profiles/user-subscriptions/subscription-states/).

## Setting User Subscriptions

You can set user subscriptions manually when you upload contacts [using Engageâ€™s CSV uploader](/docs/engage/profiles/csv-upload/). You can also use a CSV upload to correct contacts with outdated subscription states.

Most user subscriptions are updated programmatically, using Segment APIs. The Public API and the `track` call handle subscription state changes made when users sign up to or change their subscription status to your marketing materials with online forms or within notification centers.

View the [Setting User Subscriptions](/docs/engage/profiles/user-subscriptions/set-user-subscriptions/) page to learn more about user subscription changes.
