Broadcasts are one-time email or SMS campaigns that you can send with Twilio Engage. Use broadcasts for single, one-off occasions like the following:

- **Special events**, like webinars or conferences
- **Offers**, like product discount codes
- **Newsletters** that you want to send on a specific date

For more on the different types of Engage campaigns, read [Audiences, Journeys, and Broadcasts](/docs/guides/audiences-and-journeys/).

On this page, you'll find step by step instructions for how to create a broadcast.

## Working with broadcasts

Keep the following information in mind as you work with broadcasts.

### SMS segments

SMS broadcasts longer than 160 characters are split into segments and then joined together by the recipient's device. As a result, you can send SMS broadcasts longer than 160 characters, but each 160-character segment is billed individually. 

For more on message segments, view [SMS character limits](https://www.twilio.com/docs/glossary/what-sms-character-limit){:target="_blank"}.

### Email template limits

The total size of your email, including attachments, must be less than 30MB.

To learn more, view SendGrid's [email limits](https://docs.sendgrid.com/api-reference/mail-send/limitations#:~:text=The%20total%20size%20of%20your,must%20no%20more%20than%201000.){:target="_blank"}.

### Scale and throughput

The following table lists geographic availability, scale, and speed details for email broadcasts and [short code SMS](https://support.twilio.com/hc/en-us/articles/223182068-What-is-a-Messaging-Short-Code-){:target="_blank"} broadcasts:

| Broadcast type | Availability                            | Throughput                                                                 |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Email          | All countries where Engage is available | 1 million per hour                                                         |
| SMS short code | US, Canada, UK                          | 360,000 per hour                                                            |

Long-code message throughput depends on a number of factors, including your [10DLC trust score](https://support.twilio.com/hc/en-us/articles/1260803225669-Message-throughput-MPS-and-Trust-Scores-for-A2P-10DLC-in-the-US){:target="_blank"}. 

Segment recommends that you use short code phone numbers for SMS broadcasts sent to more than 5000 recipients.
