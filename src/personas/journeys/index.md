Journeys enable you to define steps in a user's journey based on event behavior and traits. You can build Journeys from your tracking events, traits, computed traits, or audiences. At each step of a journey, you can send your list of users to any personas-compatible destination.

## Get started

Start with the visual builder to define entrance criteria, build out conditional branching logic, then focus messaging to drive conversion. Repeat purchase campaigns, trial conversions, and onboarding flows are great examples to get started from. For more information, see [Build a Journey](/docs/personas/journeys/build-journey).

## Send data to your destinations

Connect destinations to your Journey to send events or user lists when users reach the corresponding step in the Journey. For more information, see [Send Journeys data to a Destination](/docs/personas/journeys/send-data).
