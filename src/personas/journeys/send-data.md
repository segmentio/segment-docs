title: Send Journeys data to a Destination
---
{% include content/plan-grid.md name="journeys" %}


When you send data to destinations, you send a series of events or user lists, depending on the destination type.

## Before you begin

Ensure you have connected and enabled destinations in your Personas space.

For more information, see [Setting up Destinations](/docs/personas/quickstart/).

## Send data to destinations

1. Add a **Send to destinations** step to the journey.
2. Enter a **Step name**. This name should be descriptive of the users you send to the destination. For example, `New subscribed users`. Journeys generates a key based on the step name you enter. Destinations use this key to references the users that Journeys sends to it. For track events, the property name uses this key. For Identify events, the trait name uses the key.
3. Click **Connect destinations** to select the destination you'll send the data to.
4. Click **Save**.

## What do I send to destinations?

The data type you send to a destination depends on whether the destination is an Event destination, or a List destination.

### Event destination

The format in which the destination receives updates depends on the call type.

#### Track calls

When the user enters the step:

```json
{
  "type": "track",
  "event": "Audience Entered",
  "properties": {
    "j_o_first_purchase__opened_email_dje83h": "true"
  }
}
```

#### Identify calls

When the user enters the step:

```json
{
  "type": "identify",
  "traits": {
    "j_o_first_purchase__opened_email_dje83h": "true"
  }
}
```

### List destination

The destination receives a list of users who qualify for the associated journey step. Unlike lists associated with Personas Audiences, users who are added to a journey list cannot be subsequently removed. See [best practices](/docs/personas/journeys/faq-best-practices#suppress-targeting-with-journey-lists) for techniques to suppress targeting with journey lists.
