## Selecting your use case

Follow these steps to identify which use case to implement:

1. Identify your primary business challenge or goal from the four business goals.
2. Review the use cases associated with that goal, considering how each aligns with your specific needs.
3. Evaluate your current data collection capabilities and the resources you have available.
4. Consider your long-term business strategy and how different use cases might support your future goals.
5. If you're unsure, start with a use case that addresses your most pressing current need. 

The use case you select will guide your Segment setup, including the events you'll track and the integrations you'll implement. However, Segment's flexibility allows you to adapt and expand your strategy over time as your business needs evolve.

The following sections explore each business goal and associated use cases in detail.
