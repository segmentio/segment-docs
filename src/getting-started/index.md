With Segment, you can collect, transform, send, and archive your [first-party customer data](https://segment.com/books/customer-data/first-party-data/). We simplify the process of collecting data and hooking up new tools, allowing you to spend more time using your data, and less time trying to collect it. You can use Segment to track events that happen when a user interacts with the your interfaces. "Interfaces" is our generic word for any digital properties you own: your website, mobile apps, and processes that run on a server or OTT device.

When interaction data is captured in Segment, you can send it (often in real-time) to a wide variety of tools in the analytics, data warehousing, and marketing spaces, usually without having to add new tracking code to production applications.
