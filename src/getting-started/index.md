With Segment, you can track [first-party customer data](https://segment.com/learn/download/fundamentals-first-party-data/){:target="_blank‚Äù}, like interactions with your websites, mobile apps, and processes that run on a server or OTT device, and can send that data, either as individual events or as an aggregate view of a customer's behavior, downstream to different business tools.

Segment simplifies the process of collecting data and connecting new tools, allowing you to spend more time using your data and less time trying to collect, process, and share it with business tools. In most cases, you won't even need to touch your tracking code to connect to new tools.
