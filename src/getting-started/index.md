With Segment, you can collect, transform, send, and archive your [first-party customer data](https://segment.com/books/customer-data/first-party-data/). We simplify the process of collecting data and hooking up new tools, allowing you to spend more time using your data, and less time trying to collect it. You can use Segment to track events that happen when a user interacts with the interfaces. "Interfaces" is our generic word for any digital properties you own: your website, mobile apps, and processes that run on a server or OTT device.

When you capture interaction data in Segment, you can send it (often in real-time) to your favorite tools marketing, product, and analytics tools, as well as to data warehouses. In most cases, you won't even need to touch your tracking code to connect new tools.
