You're just getting started with Segment, but there's so much more to explore!

## Privacy tools and filtering

Segment includes a suite of Privacy tools to help your organization comply with regulations like the GDPR and the CCPA.

The [Privacy Portal](/docs/privacy-portal/portal/) allows you to easily audit, monitor, and enforce privacy rules against your Segment data, to proactively protect your customers.

## Data governance with Protocols

You had a taste of the planning and coordination needed to set up clear, consistent, reliable and extensible tracking systems on page 3, [Planning a Full Install](03-planning-full-install). Business tier customers can use [Protocols](/docs/protocols/), Segment's data governance solution, to streamline and coordinate the creation and maintenance of tracking schemas, and to ensure that data coming into your Segment workspaces conforms to the standards you set. 

## Single view of the customer with Personas

[Personas](/docs/personas/) is a powerful personalization platform that enables you to create unified customer profiles in Segment, to build and enrich audiences, and to activate audiences across marketing tools.

With Personas, you can create unified customer profiles, enrich those profiles with new traits, build Audiences using those profiles, and sync audiences to marketing tools to power personalized experiences, and better understand your customers.
