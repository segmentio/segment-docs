You're just getting started with Segment, but there's so much more to explore!

## Privacy tools and filtering

Segment includes a free suite of Privacy tools to help your organization comply with regulations like the GDPR and the CCPA.

The [Privacy Portal](/docs/privacy/portal/) allows you to easily audit, monitor, and enforce privacy rules against your Segment data, to proactively protect your customers.

## Improve data quality with Protocols

You had a taste of the planning needed to set up clear, consistent, reliable and extensible data schemas in [Planning a Full Install](/docs/getting-started/03-planning-full-install/).

Business tier customers can use Segment's [Protocols](/docs/protocols/) package to help with this process, to keep track of what data is being collected where, and to normalize their data as it flows through Segment. Clean, consistent data helps you move faster to build marketing campaigns and act on analytics insights.

With Protocols, you can use [Tracking Plans](/docs/protocols/tracking-plan/create/) to build consensus in your organization about which events and property you intend to collect across your web, mobile or server-side data sources. Once defined, you can connect the Tracking Plan to your Sources to automatically [validate](/docs/protocols/validate/) the data is flowing correctly. You can also turn on [enforcement](/docs/protocols/enforce/) to block bad data, and even fix incorrect data with [Transformations](/docs/protocols/transform/).

## Single view of the customer with Personas

[Personas](/docs/personas/) is a powerful personalization platform that enables you to create unified customer profiles in Segment, to build and enrich audiences, and to activate audiences across marketing tools.

With Personas, you can create unified customer profiles, enrich those profiles with new traits, build Audiences using those profiles, and sync audiences to marketing tools to power personalized experiences, and better understand your customers.
