title: PII Access
description: |
  PII Access enables limits on PII visibility for any workspace user while allowing them to continue to use various Segment features PII is automatically masked to all workspace users unless explicitly granted access by the workspace owners. This allows customers to raise the bar on end-user data protection while harnessing Segment's full power to achieve their business priorities.
