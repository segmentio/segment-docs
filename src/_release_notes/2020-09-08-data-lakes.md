title: Segment Data Lakes
description: |
  As data strategies become increasingly complex and the volume of data rapidly scales, Warehouse customers are starting to move to a more flexible data architecture model to de-couple storage from compute in order to easily glean insights from raw Segment data while optimizing for scale, cost and performance.

  Segment Data Lakes bridges the gap between a traditional data lake and a data warehouse by building a clean data lake on top of Segment data.

  Segment Data Lakes empowers Data teams with new ways to glean insights directly from raw Segment data to effectively power advanced analytics and data science use cases across the business.
