title: Identity Onboarding
description: |
  All new Personas customers are taken through a guided workflow to set up their identity resolution rules. Based on a user's selections, Personas provides a standard set of identity rules. From there, users can add or edit identifiers and properties, or set custom identifiers based on their unique business rules, from the Identity Resolutions Settings page.
